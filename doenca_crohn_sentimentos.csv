Abscesses when pregnant,"So Ive already posted an extremely long post on another sub about this so I wont go into too much detail here or Ill be typing all night 

I F residing in the UK was diagnosed with Crohns when I was  so half my life ago Its been up and down over the years with various meds etc Am currently on Yuflyma adalimumab injections though am unsure how much they are doing as I have been in an on off flare since just after the height of the pandemic It is pretty active right now I had surgery last May to fit a Seton as I have a fistula

Last week I developed two abscesses out of the blue one gluteal one perianal I had a procedure last Saturday night to incise and drain these An added complication is that I am currently almost  weeks pregnant with my first child so this was done under epidural rather than GA It all went well dressings are being changed by nurses every day and wounds are healing well

Two days ago I developed swelling in my labia and I realised it was a recurrence of a Bartholins cyst Id had a couple of times previously though not had it for a while This had actually been seen and confirmed by my IBD consultant from the MRI images I had to confirm the presence of the fistula around  months ago

Im now on antibiotics as they obviously want to avoid another surgical procedure so soon after the other one especially with me being pregnant

My GP is concerned about me developing all these infections so close together I also currently have a UTI and is testing me for gestational diabetes just in case 

I do have an appointment with the specialist antenatal IBD clinic on the th Feb though only a telephone one which Im not happy about with all Im going through and the fact they were supposed to see me soon after my  week scan but thats whole other can of worms Hopefully some answers and a plan of action will come then

I guess Im just wondering if anyone else has experience of abscesses like this during pregnancy Was it GD or just down to the sheer unluckiness of having IBD 

This latest one is painful because of the location far more than the others and I am barely sleeping with the pain so any tips on relief will be appreciated too due to my dressings sitz baths are ruled out

This has still turned out longer than planned so thanks to anyone who reads it andor replies",2025-02-15 01:16:53,444,already posted extremely long post another sub go much detail typing night f residing uk diagnosed crohn half life ago year various med etc currently yuflyma adalimumab injection though unsure much flare since height pandemic pretty active right surgery last may fit seton fistula last week developed two abscess blue one gluteal one perianal procedure last saturday night incise drain added complication currently almost week pregnant first child done epidural rather ga went dressing changed nurse every day wound healing two day ago developed swelling labium realised recurrence bartholin cyst couple time previously though actually seen confirmed ibd consultant mri image confirm presence fistula around month ago antibiotic obviously want avoid another surgical procedure soon one especially pregnant gp concerned developing infection close together also currently uti testing gestational diabetes case appointment specialist antenatal ibd clinic th feb though telephone one happy going fact supposed see soon week scan thats whole worm hopefully answer plan action come guess wondering anyone else experience abscess like pregnancy gd sheer unluckiness ibd latest one painful location far others barely sleeping pain tip relief appreciated due dressing sitz bath ruled still turned longer planned thanks anyone read andor reply,Positivo,0.9344,Neutro
First Resection after 9 years of Crohn's Experience,"Hi Im   in March male and had been diagnosed with Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis for about  years now first diagnosed in  I just wanted to share my story of this resection as I saw many reddit posts about resection and recovery and hope that my experience could also help in some ways to others planning to have this surgery

Talks of this surgery came to light after I had a colonoscopy with a new GI doctor that my old GI doctor recommended me to apparently this new GI doctor had a more of a focus on IBD She told me that they had found a stricture at my cecum first part of my large intestines and was worried I may have a stricture in my small intestines So she decided to order a CT Enterography wwo contrast

After drinking  bottles of Breeza god this drink will give me nightmares I got my CT done Almost a day after the GI doctor contacted me with bad news not only was there a stricture at my ileum but due to scarring and all there was a fistula created with abscess near my ileum and instructed me to go to the ER the next day for surgery TBH I wasnt feeling bad minus some pain near the site so I was a little shocked that this needed to be done

I went to the ER Saturday morning got checked in and got hooked up on IV fluids and IV antibiotics I was on NPO from then to the day before surgery in which they changed my diet to clear liquids and then back to NPO Unfortunately I had to wait till Monday for any plansupdates since no one was working during the weekends Once Monday hit I met my colorectal surgeon who told me I would have a laparoscopic resection of my ileum that would take out my small intestines appendix and my large intestines At that time I was notified it would be about cm total which was very small

After the surgery was done on the following day Tuesday I dont remember much since I think I was still under the effects of anesthesia and just wanted to sleep I do remember having a lot of nightmares that night and continuous nights after which I found was pretty interesting The next day Wednesday I met the colorectal surgeon again who described to me that they had found a larger portion of my intestines were damaged by Crohns and it became a major surgery having to take out  inches of my small intestines and  inches of my large intestines

In total I have four little incisions covered up with heart gauzes how cute and one large vertical incision maybe about  inches near my belly button covered up with gauze Im not able to physically see these incisions due to the gauze but this is just what Im guessing

Thursday was probably the WORST day I had read about peoples advice on this subreddit regarding how to recover from the gas in my stomach making me super bloated and hurting everywhere and they had said to walk So throughout the day I went from walking a lap going to sleep walking a lap going to sleep etc for about  times

That night I had the worst cramping ever and my stomach kept hurting and feeling better over and over again I did get oxycodone and some other meds for my pain and nausea during Wednesday but I wanted to not take as much as I read it could slow down recovery So during Thursday I resorted to only Tylenol and the blood thinning medication that they had to give me as well as the IV antibiotics And after some time at night I had my first gas pass out of my body and shortly after my first bowel movement A little TMI the bowel movement wasnt much as I didnt have any solids and the IV antibiotics were not helping with the stools either very watery

On Friday today after passing a lot of gas and frequent bowel movements the colorectal surgeon deemed I could be discharged later in the afternoon I was still bloated due to air in my stomach but I still felt a lot better and they had also changed my diet to a low fiber diet I was then sent home later in the afternoon with some antibiotics and no Crohns medication for now

Since the surgery happened on Tuesday its only been  days after the surgery Im still definitely having some pain and bloated but I do feel a lot better now I read somewhere that the hardest part of recovery is not knowing if I have to fart poop or both at the same time and yeah its definitely true I just have to run to the bathroom whenever I feel something Its still a little hard to walk and do stuff normally but Im hoping around the week mark I should feel better

Feeling defeated,"Hey Im a longtime lurker and first time poster here I am feeling really defeated with my Crohns I have been on three medications and now my doctor is looking into starting me on a fourth medication

I started on budesonide when I was newly diagnosed but when that doctor brought me up to  pills a day I knew something was off and I switched doctors I was put on Stelara which didnt really feel like it made a difference to me 

Then I switched to Skyrizi I thought I had made a ton of progress I was still super exhausted and my stomach would hurt every now and then but I was so happy It wasnt the crazy flareups which led me to being diagnosed in the first place

Which brings us to today I go in for a colonoscopy and they found ulcers in my intestine which I had never had before They told me were going to try Remicaid

I am so frustrated by this latest news How could it have gotten worse and I didnt know

Also can you talk to me about Remicaid They dropped a lot on me in my groggy state and didnt even let my husband in there to hear all of it

The dreaded question: how much blood is too much blood? (seton surgery recovery),"I just got my first ever seton put in  days ago and have been having small bowel movements that consisted mostly of diarrhea It wasnt until today when I started moving around a lot more that I finally had a proper bowel movement With this came a huge amount of blood I would say about half a pint definitely enough to make the toilet bowl look dark dark red and concerning My doctor told me that bleeding after surgery was normal as long as the bleeding stops and is not continuous It did stop after I was finished but I am still concerned about the amount that I have lost I have so far had  bowel movements that have gone the exact same way 

Is it hospital time Im doing ok otherwise only slight pain when I use the bathroom and I feel a bit sleepy probably still feeling the meds that they gave me

Having a lot of problems and pain not sure what to do.....,"About two years ago I started experiencing severe stomach pain particularly in my lower back and upper right back Over time the pain moved to the front and settled on the right side of my abdomen After about nine months of this I underwent a colonoscopy where doctors found an ulceror something similarin my terminal ileum A CT scan at the ER later confirmed I had terminal ileitis

Eventually I switched doctors My new doctor performed an MRI and another colonoscopy He prescribed Miralax twice a day along with fiber tablets which I took for two to three months However my symptoms kept worsening The pain became so severe and stabbing that I could barely function

In July  I had another colonoscopy with the same doctor and this time he found three ulcers in my terminal ileum Shortly afterward he and his nurse both went on vacation leaving me without treatment for six weeks Eventually I was put on prednisone for three and a half months Around November  I started Humira while tapering off prednisone At that point my doctor advised me to continue taking Miralax since I had stopped

As I tapered off prednisone many of the symptoms that had previously improved began to return and new ones emerged Due to insurance issues I wasnt able to start Humira immediately but I eventually got that sorted Around the same time I began experiencing severe pain in my lower left abdomen particularly around my descending and sigmoid colon It felt like bowel movements were moving too slowly or getting stuck My doctor again recommended Miralax but I hesitated after reading that laxatives could cause intestinal damage He reassured me this wasnt the case and urged me to follow his advice rather than rely on internet sources

About three weeks ago I had another appointment I typically see him once a month or every eight weeks He diagnosed me with severe IBS and mild Crohns disease saying the Humira should be working In some ways I do think its helping but in others Im not sure its fully effective He also pointed out that my diet is terriblewhich hes right aboutand emphasized the need for change Im working on it but its difficult He also recommended Miralax or a stronger laxative suspecting that undiagnosed constipation could be contributing to my symptoms

Occasionally I experience what people on this subreddit call lava gut along with severe sometimes burning pain in my lower left abdomen Thankfully the pain in my terminal ileum has mostly subsided While I still feel discomfort there occasionally its much less frequentabout once a week Based on anatomy diagrams my current pain seems centered in my descending and sigmoid colon At times its so intense that it feels like it wraps around a specific area radiates to my back or is concentrated in one spot

A few times I ate something mildly spicylike a McDonalds chicken sandwich I think I had twoand the burning sensation was so severe I thought I was going to die It was bad enough that I called my doctor but his nurse told me that the intestines dont have nerve endings and that I couldnt be feeling a burning sensation there That left me confused about what I was actually experiencing Even when the pain subsides by about  theres still a lingering discomfort Sometimes bowel movements are painfulsometimes very severelywhile other times the pain disappears Passing gas can also be painful at times but not always

When I have flareups which seem to occur weekly the pain follows a pattern it starts off mild progressively worsens peaks for two or three days and then gradually improves Ive also noticed that my symptoms sometimes start to ease two or three days after my  mg Humira injection Its not an immediate effect so I cant say for sure if thats the cause but I wonder if I need to increase my dosage from  mg and injection to more or take Humira four times a month instead of two I wonder also Im ftinch lbs so Im somewhat a bigger guy I wonder if theres not enough humera in me because Im so big but maybe it doesnt work that way However I worry about potential antibody buildup liver damage and other side effects Honestly Im just worried about everything",2025-02-14 17:28:58,728,two year ago started experiencing severe stomach pain particularly lower back upper right back time pain moved front settled right side abdomen nine month underwent colonoscopy doctor found ulceror something similarin terminal ileum ct scan er later confirmed terminal ileitis eventually switched doctor new doctor performed mri another colonoscopy prescribed miralax twice day along fiber tablet took two three month however symptom kept worsening pain became severe stabbing could barely function july another colonoscopy doctor time found three ulcer terminal ileum shortly afterward nurse went vacation leaving without treatment six week eventually put prednisone three half month around november started humira tapering prednisone point doctor advised continue taking miralax since stopped tapered prednisone many symptom previously improved began return new one emerged due insurance issue able start humira immediately eventually got sorted around time began experiencing severe pain lower left abdomen particularly around descending sigmoid colon felt like bowel movement moving slowly getting stuck doctor recommended miralax hesitated reading laxative could cause intestinal damage reassured case urged follow advice rather rely internet source three week ago another appointment typically see month every eight week diagnosed severe ibs mild crohn disease saying humira working way think helping others sure fully effective also pointed diet terriblewhich right aboutand emphasized need change working difficult also recommended miralax stronger laxative suspecting undiagnosed constipation could contributing symptom occasionally experience people call lava gut along severe sometimes burning pain lower left abdomen thankfully pain terminal ileum mostly subsided still feel discomfort occasionally much less frequentabout week based anatomy diagram current pain seems centered descending sigmoid colon time intense feel like wrap around specific area radiates back concentrated one spot time ate something mildly spicylike mcdonalds chicken sandwich think twoand burning sensation severe thought going die bad enough called doctor nurse told intestine nerve ending feeling burning sensation left confused actually experiencing even pain subsides still lingering discomfort sometimes bowel movement painfulsometimes severelywhile time pain disappears passing gas also painful time always flareups seem occur weekly pain follows pattern start mild progressively worsens peak two three day gradually improves also noticed symptom sometimes start ease two three day mg humira injection immediate effect cant say sure thats cause wonder need increase dosage mg injection take humira four time month instead two wonder also ftinch lb somewhat bigger guy wonder enough humera big maybe work way however worry potential antibody buildup liver damage side effect honestly worried everything,Negativo,-0.9978,Negativo

Misdiagnosis of Crohn’s?,"So sorry for the long post but Im going to try to fit over a years worth of info here lol Im extremely confused about my apparent misdiagnosis of Crohns and was wondering if anyone experienced something similar or has any advice on what to do going forward 

Some backstory Ive had stomach issues my entire life that and was always told it was either acid reflux or anxiety 

my husband and I were trying to get pregnant for six months when we finally got pregnant in the fall of  but had a miscarriage at  weeks  months later I woke up in the middle of the night to extreme lower right quadrant abdominal pain nausea and diarrhea I figured it was a stomach bug and rode it out It didnt go away for two weeks so I went to my pcp and they sent me to the ER for suspected appendicitis which it wasnt 

I did all the pathogen and parasite testing with no answers GI did a colonoscopy and MRI and found active ileitis and a stricture in my terminal ileum I was then diagnosed with Crohns After months of being so sick my calprotectin continuing to rise this point it was at  and losing  pounds I was only  pounds to start and being on prednisone I switched GIs 

This new GI asked if we were certain I had Crohns At this point I was so sick and couldnt eat I was adamant about the diagnosis and I was started on Remicade infusions I struggled with severe constipation to the point I was dependent on enemas to go to the bathroom Also around this time I unexpectedly got pregnant again and had another miscarriage at  weeks 

After only  loading doses of Remicade I had a second colonoscopy which showed a complete resolution of ileitis the stricture and all erosions in my small intestine Biopsy came back clear Given the fact that everything was clear inflammation was gone but I still couldnt have a bowel movement my GI sent me to the best IBD specialist in the state 

I had an appointment with her yesterday where she said I definitely dont have crohns Biopsy from first colonoscopy showed that and the first doctor shouldve known that Shes not sure whats going on thinks it could be a combo of hormonal issues and motility issues At this point I am just confused beyond words Not that I ever wanted to have Crohns but a concrete diagnosis was nice to have This specialist wants to fix the constipation and see what symptoms remain and go from there

"Kidney Failure, IBD & Carnivore Diet","Male age  UK



Hoping for some advice I suffer with Ulcerative Colitis  Crohns I was on biological injections but due to my Kidney function randomly going from  to  in December after a week in hospital they stopped me taking all medication leading to a severe flare up of UC  Crohns I have managed to get it under control slightly by eating an animal based diet basically red meat  eggs As of today  my kidneys have failed again They did recover to  function but are now back down to  Hospital admittance pending



My issue is that I have explained a number of time that the diet is helping me Ive gone from going to the toilet  times per day to twice in the last  days



The medical professionals will not entertain that something is diet related And that they need to get me on another medication ASAP

Nervous Beyond Belief,"Im shitting my pants literally and figuratively Also Im not sure how graphic is too graphic for this subreddit I figure everyone on this page has been through some version of what Im experiencing and I need to get this off my chest with people who maybe know better So maybe TW Im going to talk about my bowel movements Also also sorry this got long but maybe give it a read Im freaking out 

Okay so just for some background I got diagnosed with Crohns June  but had been having symptoms since June  I was  when I first experiencing flares low appetite and fatigue It got worse and worse as time went on but being a terrified  year old college student I did nothing It came to a point that people around me were noticing that I was having issues like losing weight rapidly sleeping excessively and of course I was on the toilet for at least  minutes at a time nearly every time I went January  at my yearly checkup with my GP I finally got the courage to tell my doctor that I was having some issues Honestly I couldnt admit to my GP that there was blood nearly every time I went and that I was going around  times a day My GP sent me for some blood tests and stool tests and even though looking at my samples visually you could tell something was wrong everything came up negative At this point I think Im crazy maybe everyone in the world is going to the bathroom this much and Im just the only person complaining about it Thats where I was mentally FebruaryMay

Cut to June  Im watching TV and I get that stupid Skyrizi commercial Id heard it one million times but had never bothered to look into what the disease it was advertising for was So now Im looking up Crohns disease and Im thinking I have a lot of these symptoms I scroll through  on TikTok and all of these stories sound like mine One of the videos freaks me out a bit some girl talking about her colostomy bag and I call my GP office and ask for a referral to a GI Within  days Im in the office describing my symptoms going all in because obviously this guy has probably heard it all no shame in what Im going through Immediately he tells me that I need to get a colonoscopy to figure out what exactly is going on with me hes telling me Im young so it might be nothing maybe just poor diet 

So now its a week later and its the day of my colonoscopy Ive done all the prep and Im sitting there with the cleanest bowel Ive ever had I go into the exam room and they walk me through everything After going through the whole debrief they put me under and start I wake up my mom is there with me and she hasnt said anything yet I figure Im groggy and she doesnt want to overwhelm me but she is flipping through the results pages She isnt telling me anything but then my doctor walks in and says Well it looks like Crohns Ileitis He runs through all the other tests that we are going to need to do to confirm it but he explains that based on what he saw he is about  sure that it is Crohns I get in the car and I start bawling I mean I had pretty much been obsessing over Crohns videos online so I know this is a forever thing My mom tells me that at least now we have answers and it can only get better from her Wrong

The next couple weeks of my summer are spent almost exclusively at the GI or getting labs done I do a calprotectin test and my doctor tells me Calprotectin levels usually range between    micrograms but your levels are at  micrograms Okay great Now Im pissed off I did all these stupid stool tests that my GP ordered in January and they all came up negative for anything but my GI orders one test and it directly points to the issue I go on prednisone and it works but I gain  pounds in a month and my face swells like Im a toddler again I start having B shots weekly because apparently my ileum is damaged to the point that I have extremely low B levels The B shots feel good between the daily iron pills and the B I have energy again 

Then I start on Skyrizi My GI tells me that Im not going to see an impact immediately like I saw with the prednisone but that over time it should make me feel a lot better Guess what it does I feel better over time maybe its the fact that Ive cut acids alcohol two drinks on my st birthday and oil almost entirely out of my diet Or maybe it is a combination of both but I feel more energized and Im not constantly on the toilet Everything is going swimmingly until I have to start doing the on body Skyrizi injections Going from Skyrizi infusions every month to every  weeks seemingly reversed all of the progress I had made I feel terrible Im in worse pain than I ever have been in and I dont know what to do Im so scared that Im going to have to start all over again and I just cant afford that mentally or fiscally I feel so stupid for not getting help earlier maybe it wouldnt have gotten so bad if I opened my mouth I just dont know if I can bare it I feel terrible So Im shitting my pants",2025-02-14 02:47:37,986,shitting literally figuratively also sure graphic graphic figure everyone page version experiencing need get chest people maybe know better maybe tw going talk bowel movement also also sorry got long maybe give read freaking okay background got diagnosed crohn june symptom since june first experiencing flare low appetite fatigue got worse worse time went terrified year old college student nothing came point people around noticing issue like losing weight rapidly sleeping excessively course toilet least minute time nearly every time went january yearly checkup gp finally got courage tell doctor issue honestly admit gp blood nearly every time went going around time day gp sent blood test stool test even though looking sample visually could tell something wrong everything came negative point think maybe everyone world going bathroom much person complaining thats mentally februarymay cut june watching tv get stupid skyrizi commercial heard one million time never bothered disease advertising looking crohn disease thinking lot symptom scroll tiktok story sound like mine one video freak bit girl talking colostomy bag call gp office ask referral gi within day office describing symptom going obviously guy probably heard shame going immediately tell need get colonoscopy figure exactly going telling young might nothing maybe poor diet week later day colonoscopy done prep sitting cleanest bowel ever go exam room walk everything going whole debrief put start wake mom said anything yet figure groggy want overwhelm flipping result page telling anything doctor walk say like crohn ileitis run test going need confirm explains based saw sure crohn get car start bawling mean pretty much obsessing crohn video online know forever thing mom tell least answer get better wrong next couple week summer spent almost exclusively gi getting lab done calprotectin test doctor tell calprotectin level usually range microgram level microgram okay great pissed stupid stool test gp ordered january came negative anything gi order one test directly point issue go prednisone work gain pound month face swell like toddler start b shot weekly apparently ileum damaged point extremely low b level b shot feel good daily iron pill b energy start skyrizi gi tell going see impact immediately like saw prednisone time make feel lot better guess feel better time maybe fact cut acid alcohol two drink st birthday oil almost entirely diet maybe combination feel energized constantly toilet everything going swimmingly start body skyrizi injection going skyrizi infusion every month every week seemingly reversed progress made feel terrible worse pain ever know scared going start cant afford mentally fiscally feel stupid getting help earlier maybe gotten bad opened mouth know bare feel terrible shitting,Negativo,-0.9954,Negativo

Newly diagnosed with Crohn's and not sure what to do,"Hello

Im writing because I was diagnosed with Crohns disease a few days ago after a colonoscopy It feels surreal and Im struggling with how to proceed

For some background Im a M Back in July I got mono and shortly after recovering I started having pain in my upper abdomen low appetite and nausea It hit really hard for a week or so where I could barely eat The doctors initially thought it was just the mono but when the stomach pain lingered they prescribed a PPI Things gradually got better started eating mostly normal regained weight etc until all that was left was a dull ache in my upper stomach that Ive had for months

When that pain didnt improve I got an upper endoscopy They found inflammation in my stomach and intestine but couldnt confirm what it was After more tests they found elevated fecal calprotectin and after a colonoscopy the doctor saw signs of Crohns

I have no idea what any of this means and I know you arent doctors per the post rules but according to the colonoscopy report in my ileon I have apthas over at least  cm several apthas from  to  cm and more severe damage to the ileon from  to  cm with apthae and  superficial ulcers Also I have slightly erythematous and oedematic mucous an right colon and some sigmoid areas with loss of vascularityoedematic The diagnosis was ileal Crohns disease over at least  cm Slight colite A note Im in Quebec so I used an app to translate the above from French so if its gibberish thats why

After the colonoscopy my doctor ordered more blood tests and an MRI and will followup in  weeks once the colonoscopy biopsy results come back In the meantime Im freaking out because all I see online are really scary outcomes which are hard to square against my one minor symptom I dont have diarrhea abnormal stools frequent poops etc so the diagnosis was a surprise

As for my questions

 Did anyone else have a similar experience What happened It sounds like Crohns is different for everyone but still wondering

 How does Crohns go from here It sounds like even with treatment it eventually gets worse until my gut is basically falling apart Can people have good outcomes and live normal lives  lifespans 

 Beyond getting the tests from my doctor and following their directions is there anything I can do now Im terrified of flaring between now and when my doctor prescribes treatment

 Anything you wish someone had told you when you were diagnosed Right now I feel like I need answers to questions I dont even know to ask

I have been on Inflectra for about  years In June  I was positive for Covid I had night sweats insomnia and other Covid symptoms

July  I had the more new symptoms not related to Crohns Slight chest tightness and a small gasp I also had slight calf pain It was brief but I still went to the ER They did a lot of tests and since I had just been visiting my wifes family in Asia they did a D Dimer test for possible pulmonary embolism X Rays and CT were normal for the most part D Dimer however was  Negative for Covid at this time and other viruses

There had also been many other abnormal test results and other signssymptoms

October I had left rear flank burning pain Not much visible Just slight redness ER thought shingles Antiviral taken The next day pain was gone I continued the antiviral through completion

November I had full body burning pain on both sides of the body Again slight redness in parts not hives or anything

Since the fall I have had a dry cough sore throat  neck tightness and skin pain on calfs forearms biceps lower back and neck The fatigue has become intense over the last couple months A few weeks ago I started having more heavy breathing Pulmonologist mentioned he heard some fluid in the lungs for the first time Itchy eyes and sporadic burry vision for a couple weeks This past week I now have ear pain as well

Each time the labs showed either infection or inflammation Negative for all viruses that they tested for

For the  following were consistently normal range RBC Hemoglobin Hematocrit MCV MCH RDW nRBC Monocyte Basophils Absolute NRBCs Absolute

Here are the abnormal tests

D DImer  in July and now down to 

WBC has been between  and

Hyrimoz reimbursement question,"My insurance is one that would take the co pay help and not apply it to my deductible  Rather than just delay paying my preference is just to pay for the Hyrimoz the first to months meet my deductible and be done  Yall gave me the heads up that there is a rebate or reimbursement option  from Hyrimoz even though its not talked about on their website  I called thanks to tips from here and after a couple of hours on hold I got most of the information I needed Hoping you guys can advise because the rep I had couldnt grasp my question and I didnt have it in me to continue holding for a different rep  

Last month I ordered my Hyrimoz paid via a credit card got an emailed receipt and received my medicine I learned about the rebate option during this time but hadnt had a chance to call  My sweet husband requested FSAHSA reimbursement immediately He never does it that fast so I didnt even think to ask him to hold off a bit so I could explore this option 

Humira my previous drug until I was forced to switch last year as many of us were was very specific about how I could not pay with our FSA card We never sought FSA reimbursement after getting Abbvie reimbursement because that didnt feel fair to us To my knowledge I cannot reverse the FSA reimbursement that we already received for the Hyrimoz Can I submit my January Hyrimoz receipt for Hyrimoz reimbursement even though I have already been reimbursed out of my flexible spending account  The FSA is my money so I was basically just reimbursing myself albeit at a discount of sorts

Its a  co pay so Id rather not leave that sitting there if I dont need to do so But I also understand if I cant So who here has been in a similar situation and what advice do you have for me

When are side effects TOO MUCH? Advice please.,"TLDR When youre on new meds how do you balance crohns relief with tolerating side effects How do you decide whats too much 

Hey everyone

Im looking for advice on how much to tolerate medication side effects 

I have tried a few meds for my Crohns Colitis  suppositories didnt respondpainful x thioprines nausea and didnt respond then infliximab remicade and for  years was controlled well 

However last year threw a spanner went through a very stressful time after an op not for IBD then kept getting infections to the point where I was constantly having to postpone infusions I was on constant antibiotics but still my GI insisted sticking with infliximab and that my GP was just giving me too much antibiotics Final straw was a hospitalisation for a kidney infection which turned into a big flare up then we decided it was time to switch

Now Im on Vedolizumab Entyvio and have been for about six months It seems to be keeping my Crohns under control  calprotectin but I cant eat as many of the foods I used to be able to on infliximab and dont feel as well While thats a bit of a bummer the bigger issue is that Ive developed burning mouth syndrome It started just feeling weird and constantly tingly then that died down and changed its now just really sore the left side of my tongue and the inside of my left cheek IBD nurse and GI werent concerned dentist didnt recognise it but just said change your meds and see not that simple Now its constantly tender looked mottled and stings when I eat especially hot drinks or anything with flavour and a lot when I brush my teeth Even when I talk my teeth against it hurts 

My IBD team and GI havent been concerned so far and are reticent to link it to the Vedolizumab as its not a listed side effect  However Ive never had anything like this before starting this medication Theyve also cautioned me against switching medications too quickly so as not to run through them too quickly 

I understand that but this mouth pain is starting to really bother me and Im worried about potential longterm damage to my mouth concerned about what this might mean for other parts of my body

So Im at a crossroads When do side effects become too much  Is it the severity the frequency or the impact on your daily life  Has anyone else experienced anything similar with Vedolizumab even if its not a listed side effect  How do you balance the need for effective Crohns control with the potential risks and discomfort of side effects  Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated Thanks",2025-02-12 20:14:45,459,tldr new med balance crohn relief tolerating side effect decide whats much hey everyone looking advice much tolerate medication side effect tried med crohn colitis suppository respondpainful x thioprines nausea respond infliximab remicade year controlled however last year threw spanner went stressful time op ibd kept getting infection point constantly postpone infusion constant antibiotic still gi insisted sticking infliximab gp giving much antibiotic final straw hospitalisation kidney infection turned big flare decided time switch vedolizumab entyvio six month seems keeping crohn control calprotectin cant eat many food used able infliximab feel thats bit bummer bigger issue developed burning mouth syndrome started feeling weird constantly tingly died changed really sore left side tongue inside left cheek ibd nurse gi concerned dentist recognise said change med see simple constantly tender looked mottled sting eat especially hot drink anything flavour lot brush teeth even talk teeth hurt ibd team gi concerned far reticent link vedolizumab listed side effect however never anything like starting medication also cautioned switching medication quickly run quickly understand mouth pain starting really bother worried potential longterm damage mouth concerned might mean part body crossroad side effect become much severity frequency impact daily life anyone else experienced anything similar vedolizumab even listed side effect balance need effective crohn control potential risk discomfort side effect advice shared experience would greatly appreciated thanks,Negativo,-0.9614,Negativo

"Recently ""Diagnosed"" and Confused AF.","m No immediate family history of Crohns maternal uncle has UC For the past few years I had IBS symptoms PCP chalked it up to roids fissures diet issues etc I started having pain in the rectum when sitting and fresh blood on the very top of poop I decided enough was enough and with Colon Cancer increasing among those my age I wanted to get checked a HS classmate didnt make it  

GI colonoscopy performed end of Jan initial results noted compatible with Crohns

A polyp mm rectum
B congestion erythema through rectum sigmoid descending transverse ascending cecum and terminal ileum
C ulcer in rectum and terminal ileum

I was put on Budesonide and on my follow up the GI noted that the biopsy results are not finalized but he has a report and its leaning towards moderate disease I asked about granulomas and he noted that it wasnt found 

The next steps GI wants is the Prometheus blood test to be sure hes treating the right thing because it could be ulcerative colitis or CD but hes leaning towards CD So I asked about next steps and he bolted towards Skyrizi even though I mentioned mesalamine he said it would be just like kicking a can down the road

I have no other symptoms of CD other than the rectal discomfort Ive made huge diet changes Now Im lost and left wondering why the biopsy wasnt definitive and why more testing isnt needed 

Im inclined to go seek a nd opinion but also dont want to delay getting on meds so I can be in remission earlier On top of this Im wondering if Im just going to die if I dont have insurancecant get meds

Inconsistency,"Apologies for TMI in advance Ive found I often have very strange patterns in flares For me my disease is not worse in the morning but instead often follows patterns around my lifestyle and how busy I am For example if Im working a lot of hours and am quite stressed I can often have  days feeling quite constipated and producing lots of blood and mucus without a proper BM followed by coming home from work on day  or  and having terrible urgent frequent loose stools until the early hours of the morning

A lot of what Ive seen and read about crohns often talks about symptoms being particularly worse in the morning but I find for me I can become really constipated if Im busy but then the minute I relax a bit or have some time off I get the most horrific urgent loose stools that will appear every  minutes or so for about  hours until I eventually give in and take an Imodium or  to be able to sleep and get through the next day

"My old infusion provider is out of network. The new place won't give me my infusion until my doctor can see me. By the time I even get scheduled for an appointment, I will be past due","Let me preface this by saying that I never got gleeful when the United Healthcare provider was killed Insurance has helped me out And the ability to take a Biologic medication is limited to North America and Europe Some single payer countries have copays that make a biologic inaccessible Im not saying that there arent problems with American healthcare but I am sober from alcohol and its completely changed my perspective to where I try to be grateful and dont get as worked up anymore I definitely was a dick before I got sober to insurance people Ive also been in remission for a minute so I look at what I can be grateful for 

That being said the amount of executive functioning it requires to get the biologic is crazy In the US last year this same insurance covered my old infusion place This year I was told late that it isnt covered By the time I was told that I called the new place Ive been on the phone all day and by the time I sorted it out I couldnt get an appointment in time

Im diagnosed with Schozoaffective Schizophrenia and Bipolar and ADHD These mess up executive functioning Im working full time as a software engineer and taking Computer Science courses at college The only way Ive been able to counteract they mental stuff is by running  or more miles every day or cycling for an hour Some days I also swim or lift 

I couldnt run with Crohns for years Even in remission I was put on Wellbutrin for a Bipolar depressive episode  and when I drank coffee on that med I was energetic and anxious As dysfunctional as it sounds I just did that and ran until I was in good shape again

Ive had Crohns for  years but recently received clinical diagnosis 

Ive also been diagnosed with ADHD  months ago 

Recently I had a panic attack  potential important info

My ADHD Dr told me he has patients on over mg Elvanse and some even on  

In December I went up to mg and it still has no effect on me Because of this and my dr saying he has patients well above mg I decided to and wrongly try mg for a few days to see if it would have an effect 

On mg I got head aches and sore throat and decided to stop taking all medication completely 

That night I looked into what could be causing my head aches and sore throat and found people saying thats when the dose was too high for you which I felt anyway and had already stopped 

I then found a user who mentioned a condition called SJS which is a serve reaction to medication and I had a panic attack because symptoms were similar But after thinking Ive been on Elvanse for  months and havent had any symptoms I calmed down 

This week I got a clinical diagnosis of crohns Could my sore tongue be a flare up of Crohns because I was so stressed and the panic attack could have ultimately caused this

Please ask any further questions Ill be happy to answer Thanks in advanced",2025-02-11 20:05:46,268,feel like panic crisis apology miss information issue back tongue feel bruised sore background crohn year recently received clinical diagnosis also diagnosed adhd month ago recently panic attack potential important info adhd dr told patient mg elvanse even december went mg still effect dr saying patient mg decided wrongly try mg day see would effect mg got head ache sore throat decided stop taking medication completely night looked could causing head ache sore throat found people saying thats dose high felt anyway already stopped found user mentioned condition called sjs serve reaction medication panic attack symptom similar thinking elvanse month symptom calmed week got clinical diagnosis crohn could sore tongue flare crohn stressed panic attack could ultimately caused please ask question happy answer thanks advanced,Negativo,-0.991,Negativo

Partner with a flare and relationship struggles,"Hi everyone I want to ask people who have Crohns if theyve experienced something similar and if theres hope that things might improve once my partner starts feeling better

Hehas been going through a flare for the past six months He says he feels unwell but his symptoms dont seem to be severe Throughout our relationship Ive noticed certain behaviors that have been really difficult to deal with and I wonder how much of it is due to his illness and how much is just who he is

For example
 He struggles to keep commitments and prioritize our relationship even with simple things like coming home when he says he will or following through on basic promises
 He spends many hours playing video games or with his friends and when I ask him to do something for our relationship he gets irritated or avoids it
 His libido is almost nonexistent which makes me feel rejected and undesired
 He has no initiative to work or move forward in life and although he talks about starting a family he does nothing concrete to build that future
 Every time I try to talk about how I feel he tells me hes too stressed because of his illness and that I need to be more understanding
 When I express my needs he either dismisses them tells me Im overreacting or acts like Im adding to his stress rather than trying to work through things together

So my question is
 Have any of you gone through a phase where you felt too drained to invest in your relationship but things got better when your health stabilized
 After a flare did you regain more energy and motivation for your responsibilities and your partner
 Or do you think that if someone has this pattern of behavior its unlikely to change even when they feel better

Meds,"Has anyone been taken off skyrizi to be put on another med then go back to skyrizi

 I dont think the skyrizi failed I think and my family doc thinks that I over did it with the dairy and it caused too much inflammation in my gut for the skyrizi to work properly I only had my loading doses and one maintenance dose Im just hoping that I can go back on it I want my life back

Skyrizi Reinfusion,"Hi all

I searched this forum and didnt find much on this topic Ive been on Skyrizi for around  months Overall Ive been doing very well I have an ulcer at my anastomosis site that is giving me trouble and likes to bleed Im still having pain in that area intermittently and since it likes to bleed my GI and myself are a little cautious about it Since Im doing so well on Skyrizi otherwise he is recommending to reinfuse me with the  loading doses then move to OBI every  weeks rather than  

 He explained it as the loading does are around  mg for example I dont recollect exact numerical values We get three loading doses so you get a very large dosage of medication in your system Most people start to feel great after these  doses Then when you move to OBI which is around only  mg of medication every  weeks The large amount of medication slowly decreases over time in the body and can start leading to symptoms to appear 

When you get reinfused and increase OBI frequency you are attempting to recapture that initial huge loading dose and then work to maintain it by taking the OBI twice as often My GI doc says he has had a lot of success in doing this  Just wanted to share this as anybody who started off great on Skyrizi and is starting to get symptoms again this may be a conversation to bring up with your GI doc and see if they have any familiarity with this",2025-02-11 12:19:46,266,hi searched forum find much topic skyrizi around month overall ulcer anastomosis site giving trouble like bleed still pain area intermittently since like bleed gi little cautious since skyrizi otherwise recommending reinfuse loading dos move obi every week rather explained loading around mg example recollect exact numerical value get three loading dos get large dosage medication system people start feel great dos move obi around mg medication every week large amount medication slowly decrease time body start leading symptom appear get reinfused increase obi frequency attempting recapture initial huge loading dose work maintain taking obi twice often gi doc say lot success wanted share anybody started great skyrizi starting get symptom may conversation bring gi doc see familiarity,Positivo,0.9778,Positivo

What is your definition of a “flare”,"I have been diagnosed with Crohns since Oct  What started it with me it was in August  I finished dinner and getting up from the table feeling like someone punched me below my stomach and left behind a flaming coconut It was so bad it made me change how I slept ate coughed sneezed etc all the time I was getting diagnosed This lasted an entire month First my doctor thought it was IBD then he thought it was a hernia then a CTMRI and Endoscopy and Gastroscopy confirmed it in Oct

Ever since then  Imuran a day and initially prednisone now Im on budesonide for another month to bring down any left over inflammation anytime anything does happen it is not meeting my definition of a flare because I only have that initial experience to compare it to 

I told this all to my gastroenterologist and he asked if I still have flares I said sometimes a bit of cramps some diarrhoea but it passes quickly and does not last long

Anything I have had is gone very quickly

He said that isnt a flare

"Finally doing the ""right"" things but am getting worse","I was diagnosed with Crohns at  and am now  When I was younger my parents forced me to go get scans and address my Crohns but I always had medical anxiety specifically being put under with anesthesia Eventually I moved out of my parents house and pretty much stopped any medical treatment No pills no doctors visits no scopes I felt ok Symptoms included pooping x a day and seeing some blood once every few months But I rationalized the pooping as being down to me eating a lot its true I eat a LOT compared to most people Nevertheless I had an ongoing anxiety about having colon cancer and I couldnt get it out of my head It had been  years since I had any scopes

In September of  I finally got a colonoscopy I was fully awake with no sedation honestly not a bad experience would recommend so I got to see the state of my colon first hand Despite not seeing blood in my stool there were ulcers throughout my colon The doctor described the inflammation as mild to moderate throughout pretty much the entire colon He recommended to start with a short dose of mg prednisone and then move on to Remicade for a longterm solution

For the first time in my adult life I decided to listen to medical advice I got on the prednisone and almost immediately felt better My stool started to harden up and I was feeling really optimistic for about  weeks Thats when the bleeding started The poop had become large and often hard and started having visible red streaks all over it All this was happening while I was tapering off the prednisone It kept escalating and eventually I started pooping straight blood before any poop would come out I scheduled an emergency appointment with my doctor I told him what was happening and he recommended upping the dosage until I could get on Remicade had to be approved by insurance 

Eventually I finally got on Remicade and the bleeding stopped I was able to taper off the prednisone and all was good for about  weeks The Remicade was making my bowel movements harder and more constipated once again and eventually the streaks returned But this time they went away on their own so I hoped all was good I am now fully ramped on Remicade and my next dose is in two months The bleeding has started again this week Except this time it doesnt seem to be going away and doesnt seem to be just streaks

Im at a loss My doctor said its extremely unusual for a flair to start while starting prednisone but thats exactly what happened When I brought up the possibility of it being from scar tissue in my rectum he said the colonoscopy showed most of the inflammation was elsewhere and dismissed the idea I somehow feel worse after doing the right thing and taking medication and I dont know what to do Does anyone have experience with this Specifically constipation which is possibly worsening inflammation",2025-02-10 13:57:12,519,diagnosed crohn younger parent forced go get scan address crohn always medical anxiety specifically put anesthesia eventually moved parent house pretty much stopped medical treatment pill doctor visit scope felt ok symptom included pooping x day seeing blood every month rationalized pooping eating lot true eat lot compared people nevertheless ongoing anxiety colon cancer get head year since scope september finally got colonoscopy fully awake sedation honestly bad experience would recommend got see state colon first hand despite seeing blood stool ulcer throughout colon doctor described inflammation mild moderate throughout pretty much entire colon recommended start short dose mg prednisone move remicade longterm solution first time adult life decided listen medical advice got prednisone almost immediately felt better stool started harden feeling really optimistic week thats bleeding started poop become large often hard started visible red streak happening tapering prednisone kept escalating eventually started pooping straight blood poop would come scheduled emergency appointment doctor told happening recommended upping dosage could get remicade approved insurance eventually finally got remicade bleeding stopped able taper prednisone good week remicade making bowel movement harder constipated eventually streak returned time went away hoped good fully ramped remicade next dose two month bleeding started week except time seem going away seem streak loss doctor said extremely unusual flair start starting prednisone thats exactly happened brought possibility scar tissue rectum said colonoscopy showed inflammation elsewhere dismissed idea somehow feel worse right thing taking medication know anyone experience specifically constipation possibly worsening inflammation,Positivo,0.9734,Neutro

Need Some Reassurance/Advice--Possible Colon Cancer (Or Not?),"Sit down and listen well read a tale of the best of times and the worst of times

So I went in for my colonoscopy four days ago expecting a lot of thingsbeing told to go home because I botched the prep polyps in my colon hemmoroids even being told I had to get new medication because my budesonide isnt working even though it is  I was diagnosed with Crohns back in  and Ive actually been doing really wella few flares but very mild  The doctor doing the colonoscopy was about as friendly as a tiger with an infected tooth but everyone else was cool  I passed out from the anesthesia thinking this wasnt so bad

I wasnt anticipating waking up and being told by the same doctor that I have colon cancer  Yep she says youve got a large mass in your colon enough that if it gets any bigger its going to start blocking things  No idea what stage but were scheduling you for CT scans blood tests oncology appointments surgery because at the very least that sucker has to come out  I went home and alternately cried and slept badly for the next  hours  I started planning my funeral  Something that big has to be Stage IV and thats ball game  I have the same chances to live that the Chiefs had of winning the Super Bowl by the th quarter

But a funny thing happened on the way to the funeral  I checked MyChart to see if the biopsy was back yet  It was  I was shaking as I opened it on my phone and it saidno cancer detected  They had taken out several slices and two people had gone over itand nothing  I felt like the guy scheduled to be executed and the Governor stepped in with a full pardon  I may have danced after I got home and I definitely cried despite being the manliest of men

But then a funny thing happened on the way to the party  The doctor calls today on a Sunday which is surprising and tells me the good newsand then says I dont believe those results  I think its a false positive  That thing looked horrible to me and its big so I may have missed the cancerous part  So Im recommending that we go in again and get a second biopsy  WHAT  And youre still getting the CT scan  WHY  And you still need the surgery even if its benign  Well okay that part I agree with  It is big

So I did a stupid thing and looked up the false negative statistics  Depending on who you believe its anywhere from  to  to  most agree its in the  range  Statistically significant  Theres only one problem the doctor sounded disappointed that it wasnt cancer  She had clearly made up her mind that it was cancer and when it came back benign she cant believe it  I know this because she told me

So Im not sure what to do now  I went from figuring I was a dead man to feeling euphoric to back to wondering if Ill make it to Christmas  Im terrified of the CT scan showing cancer although I got a CT a few months ago for chest pains and nada or that its grown through the colon wall like a xenomorph chestburster  So Crohns fans my question to you is this should I tell Dr Angry Tiger to shove it and get a second opinion with a doctor who has a better attitude Are second biopsies that common  Is Dr Rage At the Sentinel genuinely concerned with my health or more concerned that she wants to be right  Can we just skip to the chase and get the resection done and over with since that seems to be the plan we do agree onand they can do the second biopsy then

"Listen to me , I need help need someone to listen","Ongoing GI Issues Severe Fatigue Oral  Genital Ulcers  Need Advice

Hey everyone

Im a yearold male from India struggling with persistent gastrointestinal and systemic issues for over four years Ive been hospitalized three times in the past two months following up with my GI specialist but Im still searching for answers

 Symptoms

 Chronic diarrhea Bristol types    occurring frequently sometimes with mucus
 Persistent abdominal pain mostly midleft and lower abdomen
 Recurrent oral ulcers multiple times a month
 Daily fatigue and general weakness
 Mild persistent fever
 Burning sensation in the abdomen
 Urgency with bowel movements
 Recent onset of a painful penile ulcer sexually inactive
 Unintentional weight loss  kg in the last month

 Findings  Tests

 Severe Vitamin B  D deficiency
 Endoscopy Last Year Atrophic gastritis chronic duodenitis
 Endoscopy Recent Atrophic gastritis chronic duodenitis  H pylori positive  gastric ulcer
 Sigmoidoscopy Hemorrhoids
 Severe UTI diagnosed recently

 Current Situation

About a month ago my symptoms flared up againdiarrhea oral ulcers extreme fatigue mild fever and the penile ulcer The only medications that have provided significant relief are

 Mesalamine  mgday  a gamechanger for several weeks
 Prednisolone  also helped significantly

 Losing Hope  Struggling for a Diagnosis

I feel like Im losing the battle Ive been fighting this for four years and now I have no energy left to continue without a proper diagnosis The worst part is that a particular diagnosis cant be made just based on my reports so I keep getting different opinions

Recently I found one doctor who strongly suspects Behçets disease and CVID Common Variable Immunodeficiency However there are still peopleincluding some doctorswho dismiss all my symptoms and say its just IBS I dont understand how they can be so blind even with a medical degree when my reports clearly show ulcers infections and deficiencies

Im looking for any insights similar experiences or suggestions on what else I should test for Could this be IBD CrohnsUC Behçets disease celiac diseasenegative or something else I feel like Im stuck in a loop with no clear diagnosis I am  percent sure i do not have ibsd

I think I will be diagnosed with Crohn’s on Monday,"Looking for Advice from Those with a Similar Experience

Hi Im looking for opinions and testimonies from people who have been through a similar journey Any help would be greatly appreciated

Ive had digestive issues for as long as I can remember but they worsened in high school I experienced chronic constipation with occasional diarrhea In  I took Accutane for five months and after stopping I noticed my symptoms worsenedI started experiencing abdominal pain usually a squeezing sensation near my bellybutton likely from gas One episode was so severe that I went to the ER but an MRI showed nothing abnormal Around the same time I also developed eczema on my hands for the first time My doctor diagnosed me with IBS and left it at that

By  I began experiencing a persistent dull squeezing pain near my bellybutton mostly on the right side sometimes above it or on the left The pain worsened while working I stand a lot and after eating but would improve after a bowel movement One day I noticed blood in my stool for four days so I went to a GI doctor

He performed a colonoscopy endoscopy and CT scan with contrast
		CT scan Clear
		Endoscopy Mild esophageal irritation I had heartburn at the time
		Colonoscopy A small inflammatory ulcer mass in my cecum near my appendix

The biopsies did not indicate Crohns so I was diagnosed with chronic appendicitis The doctor initially suspected a bacterial infection and prescribed antibiotics but they didnt work I had my appendix removed and while the pain disappeared initially it soon returned

Recently after taking NSAIDs for the flu I had marooncolored bloody stools I went to a new GI doctor who ran tests
		Calprotectin 
		Bloodwork Low iron and vitamin D though Ive had low iron since my teens which runs in my family

I have no family history of IBD or autoimmune diseases though my dad has diverticulitis and my mom had polyps

Lately the pain on my right side has become more severe and constantmore of a stabbing pain Ive also noticed that Im feeling the urge to go to the bathroom more often usually twice a day now

I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy this Monday

Can calprotectin vary wildly from one day to the next? Need opinion on my case.,"Hey everyone

So Im ready to move on and accept I dont have Crohns

My diagnosis journey started in July  when I developed some chronic abdominal pain My calprotectin was measured at  My rheumatologist sent me to a GI doc who did a colonoscopy and it was clear Biopsies were also clear

Pain persisted and my doctor tested calpro again January  It came back at  I was on a PPI at the time so basically the GI said it was normal enough and didnt think Crohns was on the table anymore

February October  my symptoms went away completely almost from one day to the next

They came back in November Again it was mostly a constant abdominal ache that moved around Kind of a dull diffuse pain GI doctor ordered a CTE and it came back completely normal

I was diagnosed with IBS and prescribed Bentyl

I asked for a last calprotectin test to see what the number was today It came back at  meaning I guess  was the lowest the test measured and it was lower than that so basically I had no inflammation

My doctor said we can now safely rule out IBD and focus on treating it as IBS

Just wanted to have some opinions from the good people here I know nothing is ever clear cut with this disease but are the odds low enough that I can move on My calprotectin sample was produced at PM kept in the fridge overnight and brought to the lab the next morning in a cooler Can that affect the result The lab said it was fine to do it My friend with Crohns told me she does it all the time

Thank you for reading I want to move on but Im scared I might be missing something My doctor told me pill cam wasnt indicated after a clear colonoscopy clear CTE and a recent calprotectin at 

Can I trust my result or can it vary wildly from one day to the next Did keeping it overnight in the fridge ruined the sample somehow

Very anxious over all of this

Prior Auth H*ll and running out of doses,"So I moved to a new city four months ago switched doctors and all that fun stuff I had one more refill of my hyrimoz with my old GI doc so I figured I would refill it with them before transferring the prescription to my new GI Long story short I end up having to transfer it to my new doc anyways to get them to fill it and the prior authorization gets denied I dont get my rxs filled the second theyre ready because it takes up so much space in my fridge to have all the boxes so I usually wait until I have  weeks worth of medicine left 
I called CVS specialty and they said it was because my new doctor claimed that the medication wasnt working well enough for me 
Slight relevant backstory I was on Remicade for  years and then tried to switch stelara but my insurance said I had to fail humira before I could switch Then of course I get changed to the biosimilar of hyrimoz so now I think its kinda rich they suddenly seem okay with the prospect of switching to a new medication when I personally dont think Ive failed this one And my doc never mentioned switching to another med at least not to me 

So my GI decided to move my colonoscopy up from May to a week and a half from now and Im guessing its connected For an appeal andor letter of medical necessity But my GI hasnt been keeping me updated about what theyre doing with all of this I only have two doses left and I take it once a week so unless my colonoscopy results get back super quickly and I can get my medication filled super quickly I will be without my medicine for at least a week I have skipped doses before because of Covid and I was okay but you know rather not have to skip doses

I am currently enduring a flare  a first in nearly a decade after being diagnosed with IBD and having flares off and on ahead of then My remission was deep with Imuran and Inflectra and then my doctor suggested I could stop the former which led to this Im back on both now and I know it might take some time to start working

I spent a few days in the hospital to ensure nothing new was going on and they could fully evaluate my symptoms It was shown to be a mild flare they are now treating with a mg dose of prednisone which Ill start tapering mg off every week starting next week Nothing else was found  no strictures nothing serious aside from acute inflammation

I was initially told to go to the hospital because my doctor thought the prednisone was not working when i first mentioned I felt I was flaring It turned out it is working but is making me extremely constipated The GIs I spoke with suggested drinking Miralax in the mornings and nights to treat this

Now after a week on the pills the constipation is still present though I am able to go a little more more with each day  I guess due to the Miralax

Ive also developed a very dry coughthroat and congestion which my GI said was another side effect of the predisone This has been pretty stagnant since it began about  days ago Im waking up pretty much every morning with wheezing coughs that dont really feel relieved by anything Im not allowing myself to take Robitussin or anything as I do not wish to add any additional medication into my system

Does anyone have experience with these side effects Any recommendations on how to get through them until my course of steroids is over I have about another  weeks of this and I really dont want to feel like I cant do anything until Im off prednisone but at the moment it is making my ability to do things quite limited Any and all suggestions would be helpful",2025-02-07 18:04:25,357,hi currently enduring flare first nearly decade diagnosed ibd flare remission deep imuran inflectra doctor suggested could stop former led back know might take time start working spent day hospital ensure nothing new going could fully evaluate symptom shown mild flare treating mg dose prednisone start tapering mg every week starting next week nothing else found stricture nothing serious aside acute inflammation initially told go hospital doctor thought prednisone working first mentioned felt flaring turned working making extremely constipated gi spoke suggested drinking miralax morning night treat week pill constipation still present though able go little day guess due miralax also developed dry coughthroat congestion gi said another side effect predisone pretty stagnant since began day ago waking pretty much every morning wheezing cough really feel relieved anything allowing take robitussin anything wish add additional medication system anyone experience side effect recommendation get course steroid another week really want feel like cant anything prednisone moment making ability thing quite limited suggestion would helpful,Positivo,0.9071,Negativo

Extreme pain following cycle,"This is my first post here and I have been lurking since I got diagnosed  years ago And sorry in advance this post is a bit long TLDR in the bottom 

First of all I want to thank you all for making my life a little less lonely I think you all are awesome for sharing your experiences

However I am still to find someone that may have the same experience as I am starting to wonder if it even is my crohns that makes me have excruciating pain every time I get my period 

So this is my situation I F got diagnosed with crohns in my rectum and terminal ileum not native English speaker so a bit unsure if this is the correct translation in September  I have had extreme pain that starts  hours before my period starts and ends the day after my ovulation The first  hours of pain are the worst The following two weeks are bad but still manageable with regular amounts of painkillers The pain is in my rectum and in the right side of my stomachlower back This is besides the normal period pain in the uterus 

My pain started  years ago Before that NOTHING Ever I had salmonella Christmas  and the next period after that the pain started and it was unbearable I am calling in sick from work for at least two days every month unless it happens in the weekends 

So the thing is I dont have the typical crohns symptoms No diarrhea No problems going to the toilet other than the occasional constipation which I take something against to avoid I have no problems using NSAID at all although that is not an option for me currently since I am starting in fertility treatment 
Though when my pain starts the  hours before the period I start having clear red blood in my stool I also have some clear mucusslimewhateveryouwannacallit along with the blood Then when my period starts calming down blood wise then the bleeding from the rectum is also gone never to be seen by again before next cycle starts The pain is worst in the rectum in the first  hours The next two weeks then the pain in the right side of my stomachlower back takes over and becomes unbearable Everything is gone the day after I get the first positive ovulation test I think it is SO WEIRD that it all is so cycle based but all the pain is exactly where my crohns is

I have been double checked for endometriosis especially with the fertility treatment that is starting and everything looks aokay The only thing that could be my problem with my fertility is a polyp I have in the uterus which is getting removed soon 

So I guess my question is Has anyone experienced anything like this Or am I the only person ever having experienced symptoms being so cycle based 

Small note everything I have told you here I have talked with multiple doctors about and no one has any other explanation than it is probably the crohns 

I am on Amgevita adalimumab and according to all the lab tests I am in remission

I was admitted to the hospital on January th when I woke up to suddenly going to the bathroom passing large amounts of blood Turns out the anastomosis site from before had ulcerated into an arterial vessel and I ended up requiring an emergency embolization and about  liters of blood transfusion The treating hospital had a surgeon see me who said that it would be a good idea to resect that section now as the embolization they did was a life saving measure and not a guarantee the site wouldnt continue to deteriorate I agreed and  days after on January th I went in to have another  inches removed

I had some complications with what felt like a bowel obstruction after the surgery and wasnt really able to resume solid food until about  days ago I was discharged today I feel so spent and tired between  days at the hospital the pain and discomfort of the days following the surgery I was so excited to be home but I am so weak and exhausted Weirdly now I am tolerating food incredibly well today and am hoping this is a sign things are on the mend but I was just looking to see if anyone had any experiences they could share just to help me get through this My first resection went so much more smoothly and Im typing this in a brain fog to where its hard to even think straight",2025-02-07 01:03:12,310,hey male crohn patient year inch resection done year ago along end ileum beginning colon managing humira part caught guard recent experience looking anyone went similar admitted hospital january th woke suddenly going bathroom passing large amount blood turn anastomosis site ulcerated arterial vessel ended requiring emergency embolization liter blood transfusion treating hospital surgeon see said would good idea resect section embolization life saving measure guarantee site continue deteriorate agreed day january th went another inch removed complication felt like bowel obstruction surgery really able resume solid food day ago discharged today feel spent tired day hospital pain discomfort day following surgery excited home weak exhausted weirdly tolerating food incredibly today hoping sign thing mend looking see anyone experience could share help get first resection went much smoothly typing brain fog hard even think straight,Positivo,0.2116,Neutro

About to start taking Budesonide and need some comfort and personal experiences please!,"Need help  Hello everyone F

Im hoping its ok I post this here as I dont have Crohns disease however I do have Eosinophilic esophagitis EoE 

Was diagnosed maybe  months ago at most 

Im having to take  packets of Splenda and mix it with  mgml as it will make it sticky so it can stick to my esophagus and act as a protective barrier of Budesonide so it can help with inflammation in my esophagus and other issues that EoE has

Im very worried about the side effects as Ive been doom scrolling reddit and Google I dont really wanna gain weight as I already have huge self esteem problems and I dont wanna suffer from mood swings as I have BPD as well 

Im just wondering what the most common side effects are and if weight gain is one of them Im wondering what the average amount of weight is gained Ive seen a lot of other scary and concerning side effects as well 

Im also on Depo a form of birth control and Im really hoping that doesnt effect anything as well 

Id really hate it if I gained a puffy face or what others call moon face Im  and already weigh  pounds so Id like to not gain much more then that Id be more then happy to accept any tips or listen to others personal experiences 

I wouldve posted in the EoE reddit however the last post was  years ago and I kinda need some help asap Im supposed to take this and get a endoscopy to see if its actually helping I have no idea if it will be long term but I also saw it may be bad for long term usage 

Another thing to mention is depo effects your bone density making your bones weaker and I think I saw somewhere that Budesonide effects your bones as well so thats also another worry of mine 

I have no idea if I should just not take Budesonide but if I dont take this then my next option is to give myself a shot in my stomach every week I forgot what it was called but it was compared to what an epi pen is kinda like just with a shorter needle

 Lots of gas farting and silent burping sometimes immediately after eating or drinking
 Farts smell especially foul if I havent pooped in a while
 Mild fleeting discomfort in the lower left abdomen  times per week sometimes daily lasting a few seconds

 Tests Done So Far

 Colonoscopy with biopsy  One external hemorrhoid found otherwise normal No microscopic colitis  
 Stool tests  Normal with fecal calprotectin    is normal and pancreatic elastase   is normal  
 Blood tests IBD panel Celiac H pylori  All normal except for high gASCA  where  is normal but some labs consider  normal  
 CRP   mgL  is normal but ideally should be lower  
 Pill camera  Ordered waiting on insurance approval and testing

 Concerns

 The alternating constipationdiarrhea pattern seems consistent with Crohns but I dont have persistent abdominal pain weight loss or fatigue
 Smallintestine Crohns can be asymptomatic and might not show up in CRP or fecal calprotectin
 High gASCA is strongly linked to Crohns and it seems rare in healthy individuals at my level
 Is it possible this is IBS or SIBO instead Or something else

Crohn or not Crohn,"Hello everyone

My story starts last year in february Had a minor surgery for a right side inguinal hernia It was without mesh pure tissue repair entirely absorbable suture The hernia was very small and entirely made of fatty tissue no intestine at all

I had many strange reaction First the level of pain after surgery was crazy Then I had ingrown hairs on the scar that started  weeks after the surgery and it was clearly inflammatory Then about  month after still with inflammation from ingrown hairs that I had removed one after the other I started to have digestive issues  narrow stool pencil size constipation and feces apparently a bit stuck on the right side just above the hernia site First they just gave me laxative

Slowly over time it worsened and extended It was only near the hernia surgery site then the inflammation  started to spread a bit everywhere I had many ultrasound and they couldnt see anything  no recurrence of hernia no thickened walls nothing

I started to have crisis after crisis with fever I believe it was infections due to stasis of feces despite the laxative

In September I had another crisis and few days after a colonoscopy with biopsy and calprotectin check it was at  very mildly elevated and considered to be in remission range  The biopsy conclusion was weird 

Colonoscopy  Ileum with mild edema biopsies are taken Cecum ascending transverse descending colon and rectum with preserved vascular and submucosal pattern no stenosis no polyps no diverticula In the sigmoid mild edema of the mucosa with mild hemorrhagic punctation is observed

Biopsy  there is ileal mucosa with mild chronic interstitial multifocal inflammation of the lymphoplasmacytic type few eosinophils and lymphoid hyperplasia with prominent follicles In  the mucosa shows erosions the glands conserve mucin secretion there is edema hyperemia recent hemorrhage multifocal and mild diffuse lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and some eosinophils within normal range There is no activity or findings of microscopic colitis NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY Mild chronic ileitis with Peyers patch hyperplasia

Conclusion  Chronic erosionated colitis and recent hemorrage

From those datas the gastroenterologist said it was Crohn Over the next months the problem kept spreading to the rectum notably

I had an IRM and the results were even weirder  inflammation and thickening of rectal wall but they didnt see any inflammation anywhere else notably ileum Which is impossible because that day I could feel it on the right side The result made no sense but they said there were lot of feces stuck maybe hidding somthing

I have always been eating very heathy no processed food Im sportive  muscular my weight is perfect but I tried to change my diet see if it was making things better I tried a more liquid diet I tried FODMAP I tried  carb diet I tried more or less fiber Nothing was doing anything the symptoms were always more or less the same The calprotectin was slowly rising from  to  to  now The gastroenterologist gave me budesonide mg which did absolutely nothing except giving me insomnia I stopped after  month because it was wrecking my sleep and the calprotectin level was rising although I was taking it

He said its the symptoms of an early Crohn probably triggered by this minor surgery For him there is nothing else to find  no adhesions due to the surgery or anything else

I have no history of digestive issue or in my family Before the surgery my digestion has always been perfect like a clockwork and I could sometimes indulge into heavy food without ever having any problem

Im convinced that there is something else creating the problem but they dont seem to be willing to take me through more advanced tests

The facts that the problem doesnt answer to anything diet changes budesonide that I still have some weird pain along the inguinal canal where the surgery was and the lack of coherence in the results are really puzzling me

For those who have been through the diagnostic process can you tell me if you had similar experiences

"On diet, and request for possible study.","Based on the findings in  the CDED crohns exclusion diet can achieve remission where drugs fail

However none of the studies conclude the SCD specific carbohydrate diet can achieve remission only that it aids with symptoms and mucosal healing

Comparing the  diets the only foods that are excluded in the CDED that are allowable under the SCD are Kale Asparagus Leeks Artichokes certain nuts seeds seafood artificial sweeteners cheese yogurt butter coffee and alcohol It seems the the only issues with nuts and seeds is that they are hard to digest but that shouldnt be a problem for someone who was recently diagnosed and has no symptoms or internal damage SoThats a very short list If someone could find out which of these foods is the culprit for clinically inducing crohns so we can just remove it plus removing all processed foods milk products and high sugar foods which seem to be universally bad for us then that would be the end of all this insanity I realize this isnt the answer for everyone but it could be the answer for some if not many

When My Friends Started Sharing Way Too Much About Their Digestive Issues...,"Hey fellow Crohnies

So Ive had Crohns for  years now All my friends know exactly what Ive been through  the hospitalizations procedures pain and Ive always been pretty open about it and just accepted my illness as part of who I am

Recently I moved abroad and now my friends have started visiting me and staying for at least a week at a time But heres where it gets interesting Ive noticed that theyve started talking to me way more about their own digestive issues I mean Ive always been the one sharing all my problems and experiences but now theyre giving me all the details about their own digestive woes  like how they clean themselves after using the bathroom with or without a bidet and all kinds of other methods I didnt expect to hear about

It made me realize that as Crohnies were not alone in dealing with digestive issues Everyone in their own way seems to experience problems with their digestive system

Its funny though because now Im not the one talking about my poop food struggles or best toilets in town I just find it a bit amusing how casually they talk about things like explosive diarrhea vomiting all night etc I mean its almost like theyre trying to relax me about it but I usually deal with constipation or gas pain not whatever it is theyre describing But hey its making me smile so I cant complain

Anyone else have these kinds of conversations with your loved ones Its like once you open up about your issues its fair game for everyone to chime in about their own digestive drama

ADA accommodations,"I work at a university They have me parking over a half mile away from my office I have severe Crohns disease and even on my good days have unpredictable toilet needs Plus I struggle to stay hydrated which I suspect is related to my diseased colon and I currently live in Louisiana where it is extremely hot most of the year I have multiple times walked through the heat in my work clothes with all my books only to get extremely sick with a migraine and nausea After trekking back and forth to my faraway parking lot in the heat I once had to run out of a theater right before I was supposed to introduce a guest speaker so that I could projectile vomit These factors absolutely interfere with my work Plus I have chronic fatigue and sometimes experience joint pain 

I applied for accommodations simply to park closer to my building After six or so weeks they finally gave me temporary accommodations They said if I wanted to park near my building longterm I would need to get a handicapped placard 

I looked up the local laws and the only item that seems to even potentially cover me for eligibility for a placard is this   f Has a diagnosed disease or disorder including a severe arthritic neurological or orthopedic impairment which creates a severe mobility limitation  


Im really frustrated because I dont need a handicapped spot I just need to not hike over a half mile each way to teach my classes If I shit myself Im not teaching If I am feeling dicey about maybe shitting myself or projectile vomiting Im not teaching Not with that walk If I was having a bad Crohns day and not teaching I would order curbside pickup for my groceries and largely stay home But if Im flaring on a work day I am supposed to roll the dice on walking from an offcampus parking lot where there are no facilities 

This feels like a massive violation but with all the recent antiDEI and antidisability rhetoric I dont have much hope that they will do anything about it I just dont understand how I can get only several months of accommodation for what is obviously a permanent condition per my medical records and my doctors letter And all I want is to be close to my building

So context done my question is if anyone had similar symptoms and got diagnosed via MRI or Capsle Endoscopy

Active Disease vs Symptomatic,"Hello friends

My GI insists  based on my test results  that I have no active disease Yet I am still almost glued to the toilet on a daily basis and am still experiencing nausea and stomach pain but am being dismissed because my test results indicate normalcy

Still having right lower abdomen pain common with crohns and can indicate ileum inflammation

Doesnt want to scope me again just yet as I had one in October But CRP levels are within normal range FBC LFT UEC ESR all look normal

Still doing regular blood work and stool samples iron studies etc

GI said I need to be monitored closely as my condition encased a lot if not most of my small bowel and a bit of my upper GI tract  and upper GI tract is harder to operate on if there are complications

GI mentioned this is probably an onflow effect and my stomachbowel is just sensitive but I feel like anything and everything Ive tried even previously known safe foods I still have an adverse effect

Even after explaining this to him I still felt like I was  talking to a brick wall

What are my options",2025-02-02 09:41:57,200,hello friend gi insists based test result active disease yet still almost glued toilet daily basis still experiencing nausea stomach pain dismissed test result indicate normalcy still right lower abdomen pain common crohn indicate ileum inflammation want scope yet one october crp level within normal range fbc lft uec esr normal still regular blood work stool sample iron study etc gi said need monitored closely condition encased lot small bowel bit upper gi tract upper gi tract harder operate complication gi mentioned probably onflow effect stomachbowel sensitive feel like anything everything tried even previously known safe food still adverse effect even explaining still felt like talking brick wall option,Negativo,-0.0857,Negativo

Is anyone taking Pentasa? (Or the generic form),"I was taking Pentasa and it put me in remission Last month I get a call from my doctors office and they tell me the mail order service I use ran out of the medication and I have to call around local pharmacies to see who has it in stock I called around  pharmacies and no one had brand name or generic in stock at all My doctor then tells me I have to call all the pharmacies back and ask them what they recommend instead and if they have that in stock 

The place closest to my house had Apriso in stock but my doctor was not happy that choice Im not sure what he was expecting me to do at that point 

So Ive been taking the Apriso for about  weeks and winded up in the ER on Wednesday due to inflammation in my small intestine as well as fibroids The hospital didnt think the medication was the cause they didnt feel I was on it long enough and a Crohns flare up doesnt happen overnight It would be more gradual And this literally happened to me overnight  My doctor disagreed with them thinking Apriso was the cause yet he also confirmed a flare up is more gradual 

I follow up with my doctor when I got of the ER and he once again sent me on the quest for Pentasa or its generic No one seems to have it  I called the same places and some different ones Im literally at my wits end here I have no idea what to do I feel like my doctor is useless at this point Why is it my job to find this medication Why isnt his office helping me track it down

Heart issues after infusions,"Ill try to keep this short and to the point Thanks in advance for reading

In order I have been on Skyrizi Stelara and now entyvio Skyrizi didnt workout just because it didnt resolve my symptoms Stelara gave me symptoms of a PE like rapid heart beat resting heart rate  for  hours And extreme shortness of breath No PE was ever confirmed I was all clean but thats what my GI was alarmed of In the end we believe I was just allergic to it or something of that sort Ive been on Entyvio for  months and have had no issues like Stelara until this morning 
I was having an extremely rapid aggressive heart beat I could feel it in my throat I checked my blood pressure with a wrist cuff and my blood pressure was fine but my heart rate was  I also tried it with the finger monitor not sure the official name for that and it was  as well I thought this was weird because I could feel how quick and aggressive my heart beat was
 
I am  years old Only ever heart issues was a heart murmur that I was born with and it went 
Away by  years of age and never experienced issues again Heart issues run in my moms side of the family I am healthy and active for my age Little over weight but Im having serious constipation issues for months now and have thyroid issues but not overweight enough at all to have heart issues because of it This all comes as a surprise to me No im not anxious ER diagnosed me with anxiety with my first Stelara reaction  I never drink caffeine I am strictly a water drinker No alcohol either I rest all day after my infusions because the Benadryl they give me knocks me out

Renflexis side Effects,"Hi everyone 

I was just wondering if anyone has experienced this I just started Renflexis literally just finished the loading doses  and have my first maintenance dose on Tuesday 

First two loading doses went okay just tired afterwards The third one I felt really hot and just unwell at but nothing crazy hot shaking sweaty nauseous I think they did it too quickly as my GI doctor said they did it quite quickly 

However I have been having some weird shit happen lately and i genuinely need helpadvice people idk what it is how to figure that out and what to even search 

Some useful info from the jump
I have Crohns 
I have chronic migraines with aura
Low Vitamin D and B but I am actively taking large doses for those 

I have been experiencing tingling in my face and feet Think pins and needles but painful The face is usually worse in the morning and the tingling happens usually above my lip under my eyes hairline or back of neck It gets worse if I slip trip or if Im bending over lifting etc essentially happens always unless Im just standing still and sometimes it still happens I have been woken up in the middle of the night with horrible foot pain from pins and needles My eyesight also feels blurry or washed out When I get these tingles in my face I feel so hot nauseous dizzy and just like shit lol

I also feel like my face has a mild butterfly rash  No lesions just bumps and flushed I showed my doctor and he seemed kinda surprised and said it might be because they gave me the meds too quickly but it has now been  weeks and its still here and getting worse  My skin is so dry my nostrils are cracked peeling and painful 


After googling I read low B can cause nerve issues and can cause similar symptoms BUT The facial pain has gotten worse with taking high dose of vitamins Im talking a crazy high dose and Im getting IV therapy too 

Idk this might be confusing but Im stumped This facial tingling started as every once in a while and now is all day everyday and has started to become painful not just uncomfy I just want to figure this out 


Any help is appreciated I truly dont know what to do at this point and the Ontario healthcare system and my family doctor are a joke Ill answer any questions as Im not sure if this even made sense lol",2025-02-01 13:17:11,432,hi everyone wondering anyone experienced started renflexis literally finished loading dos first maintenance dose first two loading dos went okay tired afterwards third one felt really hot unwell nothing hot shaking sweaty nauseous think quickly gi doctor said quite quickly however weird shit happen lately genuinely need helpadvice people idk figure even useful info jump crohn chronic migraine aura low vitamin b actively taking large dos experiencing tingling face foot think pin needle painful face usually worse morning tingling happens usually lip eye hairline back neck get worse slip trip bending lifting etc essentially happens always unless standing still sometimes still happens woken middle night horrible foot pain pin needle eyesight also feel blurry washed get tingle face feel hot nauseous dizzy like shit also feel like face mild butterfly rash lesion bump flushed showed doctor seemed kinda surprised said might gave med quickly week still getting worse skin dry nostril cracked peeling painful googling read low b cause nerve issue cause similar symptom facial pain gotten worse taking high dose vitamin talking high dose getting iv therapy idk might confusing stumped facial tingling started every day everyday started become painful uncomfy want figure help appreciated truly know point ontario healthcare system family doctor joke answer question sure even made sense,Negativo,-0.9886,Negativo

Biologic Questions,"Backstory I was diagnosed with Crohns when I was  after  years of horrible flair ups and no answers I was put on mesalamine along with onoff usage of steroids and in my early twenties my Crohns became mild and Ive lived a relatively normal life since then other than a flare up in  Prior to  my Crohns was predominantly confined to my ilium but after the flare I now experience what I consider mild symptoms throughout my entire digestive tract My symptoms now primarily consist of ulcers in the back of my throat perianal ulcers hemorrhoids anal fissures and occasional bloody stool Compared to my teens and early twenties the pain I experience is mild and I only have these symptoms once every couple of months 

I started seeing a new PA a couple of years ago and she has been pushing for me to switch from mesalamine to a biologic Honestly I was hesitant out of fear and some imposter syndrome since my Crohns has been so mild and I had a gastro a few years prior question whether I had Crohns due to a clear colonoscopy only met the guy for the colonoscopy and never saw him again 

Over the last couple of months my symptoms have started to occur on a more frequent basis and I agreed to move to a biologic Skyrizi My initial infusion was scheduled for next week but I was informed today the appointment was canceled and I needed to have a colonoscopy and some blood work done now scheduled for the end of this month The nurse was unable to say why and I asked for an appointment with my PA to go over it I havent done a colonoscopy with this clinic and am due for one but I dont understand why my infusion was canceled

TLDR: You cannot donate STEM cells with NMDP if you have an IBD,"I just spent the last  months working up to donating my STEM cells to a leukemia patient this involved multiple blood draws and hours of health history screenings It is on my screening that I more than likely have an IBD my dad has Crohns  my gut microbiome labs point to it 

They had me go to multiple neurologists because of my unrelated migraines and kept asking for more and more clarification that my migraines will not be exacerbated by this process In doing so they didnt clock the IBD the one that is literally on my chart I have triple checked 

I was set to donate on Tuesday and was gonna start the Filgrastim injections today but yesterday I had some rectal bleeding which I told them and they asked me to go to the ER to get cleared It was just a fissure but in this process or reviewing my paperwork they finally clocked my IBD and told me that I cannot donate

Filgrastim is used to boost your white blood cells so you have enough to donate but after donation while they are depleted it can exacerbate colitis 

If you are on the registry and have IBD you cannot donate STEM cells but you can donate bone marrow which is much more difficult to recover from 

Ive been marked unavailable on the registry for at least  months or until I can show that my IBD is controlled at which point I can donate bone marrow but it is much more invasive with more intensive rehab

Shook after second opinion,"Bit of Background

Been dealing with daily IBS symptoms diarrhea bloating abdominal pain EXTREME fatigue for  years and the NHS has been a nightmare After a month gastro wait I lost kg from barely eating Went to a private consultant selffunded got fasttracked for tests on NHS

 Colonoscopy Aphthous ulcers in the ileum negative biopsies
 SEHCAT scan Diagnosed with BAM
 Small Bowel MRI Normal
 Capsule endoscopy  months later Same ulcers unchanged

A year later still suffering and finding that Colesevelam Questran and Rifixamin made no impact my gastro said if the ulcers were still there hed treat me for Crohns but they had disappeared

Second Opinion

I used my life insurance secondopinion consult service hoping for someone to consider all findings together B deficiency BAM ulcers and offer a fresh view Instead I got  minutes of being berated He was friends with my previous gastro I did not know that going in and said hes amazing and shamed me for even getting a second opinion

Some of the claims he made

 hr bloating is normal and insignificant
 Everyone with diarrhea tests positive for BAM and anyone with constipation would test negative so its a pointless test What
 BAM has no link to the ileum so therefore no link to the ulcers
 Ulcers dont come and go if its Crohns
 IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion so it must be IBS

Im exhausted This guy told me to get out of my head as it was ME who was making the symptoms worse He suggested I kick up more of a fuss if I wanted the NHS to take me seriously 

He acted like Im doctor shopping but Ive seen the same consultant his mate twice in two years I went in good faith not because I dont trust doctors but because it was a service offered to me by my life insurance I didnt choose him It was all arranged by my insurance 

And sure maybe hes right and none of this suggests Crohns without the smoking gun biopsy test but try telling that to a prospective health insurer So I am in limbo uninsured but invisible to NHS and I have wasted my one insurancecovered second opinion on this guy

How the hell do people get real answers 

I have my first inperson appointment with an NHS gastro consultant in February two years after the initial referral What do I go in and say

If that comes to nothing should I try one more time to go private but maybe avoid my local network of doctors

sutab prep saved me,"sutab colonoscopy prep is the best thing thats ever happened to me and i wish i was being dramatic 

ive been getting getting scopes since i was  and i dreaded them every time because of the miserable prep process gatorade miralax dulcolax i would be so nauseous and miserable the entire day and then would have a bad scope because i couldnt choke down the prep i even had to have my prep through an ng tube once because my body and i just absolutely refused to consume it but this time i requested the sutab pill prep and i will never go back  

i took the first set of pills at pm the night before my procedure and i took them over a minute period it says to take them with water but after the first pill i took them with apple juice because i needed something a little more viscous and just sipped water between each pill took about  minutes to start working as well and i was cleaned OUT by midnight so i didnt even take the second set 

and definitely ask for zofran i took them and i was just feeling really full after the first set of pills but i know without it i probably wouldve yaked it up

Need advice,"Hi all its been a crazy year and a half and I need some advice

Had issues in August  pushed to meet with my GI doc asap and made a bit of a plan but was also told Id be meeting a new doc because that doc was changing roles

Anyway a CT scan and surprise colonoscopy later and new doc says I need to have a bowel resection surgery  that happened on Dec th  Cue Recovery and I started taking Rinvoq in February of  Symptoms relatively the same but beginning to feel some improvement 

Jump to November  when I had surgery  to remove a stricture That goes well Afterwards a few weeks where things really felt like they were improving  fewer bowel movements betterform but since about the week after Christmas up to now I feel like Ive really not noticed any progress I take my medications religiously I have focused on a consistent diet that seemed to be working my doc wants me to eat a variety of things including uncooked veggies and other higher fiber things basically she took away all restrictions within reason 

I reached out with my concerns and she basically said Youve had  colon procedures this past year your body needs time to adjust but I was under the impression things would improve faster since I already had a period of growth and she didnt indicate otherwise at my follow up appointment in December to my November surgery Things had been going well so thats what I told her

My diet is limited with variety is how Id describe it I eat a lot of the same things throughout the week and dont notice much difference based on what I eat but I eat lots of proteins veggies fruits etcI just rotate through a few options I like to keep things somewhat simple anyway Right now my days are pretty consistently not improved I guess 

  
What might you do in this situation Would you cut back to a softer diet for a bit even though Doc said to try higher fiber options My next scope is in May and it seems that she wants me to ride it out until then and see what things look like after both surgeries Im happy to answer any clarifying questions you might have Thanks in advance",2025-01-29 13:20:44,397,hi year half need advice issue august pushed meet gi doc asap made bit plan also told meeting new doc doc changing role anyway ct scan surprise colonoscopy later new doc say need bowel resection surgery happened dec th cue recovery started taking rinvoq february symptom relatively beginning feel improvement jump november surgery remove stricture go afterwards week thing really felt like improving fewer bowel movement betterform since week christmas feel like really noticed progress take medication religiously focused consistent diet seemed working doc want eat variety thing including uncooked veggie higher fiber thing basically took away restriction within reason reached concern basically said colon procedure past year body need time adjust impression thing would improve faster since already period growth indicate otherwise follow appointment december november surgery thing going thats told diet limited variety describe eat lot thing throughout week notice much difference based eat eat lot protein veggie fruit etci rotate option like keep thing somewhat simple anyway right day pretty consistently improved guess might situation would cut back softer diet bit even though doc said try higher fiber option next scope may seems want ride see thing like surgery happy answer clarifying question might thanks advance,Positivo,0.9932,Positivo

"Nearly died from a GI bleed last year. Doctor suspects undiagnosed Crohn's, but not 100% sure.","Last summer I found myself in the ICU for  days after nearly bleeding to death from a duodenal ulcer

I wont go into all the details here but basically I had been suffering for weeks with bouts of awful back pain and bloating and my PCP had no idea what was going on One morning saw a lot of blood in the toilet first time I ever experienced this It kept coming Ended up taking an ambulance to the ER seeing a GI doc and having an emergency endoscopy

Long story short Im OK now and the ulcer is fully healed after being on a PPI

I tested negative for H pylori several times and never used NSAIDs aside from the occasional migraine or fever so the doctors dont understand how I got this

First GI doc I went to said it was an idiopathic ulcer advised stopping my PPI cold turkey and said I should be good now

That didnt sit right with me so I saw a second GI doc This guy is fantastic really listened to me and did a deep dive into my medical history He decided to do a colonoscopy just in case there was a chance I had Crohns which I understand can cause duodenal ulcers although not super common Also put me back on a daily PPI until we figure out whats going on

Did my colonoscopy a couple weeks ago and lo and behold he found a couple small ulcers in my terminal ileum Said this likely meant I had Crohns and that we would do further testing

So here are my results

 Biopsy showed inflammation but no granulomas and no signs of chronicity
 Small bowel MRI  days later came back completely normal with no signs of inflammation or damage
 Stool sample showed a normal calprotectin level of  No infections

I also have no noticeable symptoms aside from the ulcers of course No abdominal pain diarrhea nothing Ive been feeling great ever since I recovered from that ulcer last year

However with no other potential reasons for these ulcers in my terminal ileum my GI doc understandably is leaning towards attributing this to Crohns and gave me a couple options

 Do another colonoscopy in  months to check on the status of the ulcers and get another data point Potentially they resolve on their own and it ended up being due to some unknown infection or other cause If the situation gets worse start a biologic he suggested Skyrizi and check again If they are fully healed Im not sure what the plan would be but I suspect it would be continued monitoring

 Start Skyrizi now and do another colonoscopy in  months This option basically assumes I do have Crohns and Id be on some sort of medication for the rest of my life

Im leaning towards option  just because I think I will feel better about starting medication if theres another data point supporting that I likely have Crohns In any case if I start having symptoms he said to call right away and theyll get me in for another scope and medication ASAP so theres not much risk in delaying it a bit

I know this is an unusual case and its been a little hard coming to terms with the fact that I might have Crohns because I have never experienced any symptoms of it Im also in my s so its strange for this to be happening now although Ive read that lateonset Crohns is definitely possible

Just wanted to post here to see if any of you had any thoughts on what might be going on what you would do in my situation etc Thank you",2025-01-28 22:06:37,629,last summer found icu day nearly bleeding death duodenal ulcer go detail basically suffering week bout awful back pain bloating pcp idea going one morning saw lot blood toilet first time ever experienced kept coming ended taking ambulance er seeing gi doc emergency endoscopy long story short ok ulcer fully healed ppi tested negative h pylorus several time never used nsaid aside occasional migraine fever doctor understand got first gi doc went said idiopathic ulcer advised stopping ppi cold turkey said good sit right saw second gi doc guy fantastic really listened deep dive medical history decided colonoscopy case chance crohn understand cause duodenal ulcer although super common also put back daily ppi figure whats going colonoscopy couple week ago lo behold found couple small ulcer terminal ileum said likely meant crohn would testing result biopsy showed inflammation granuloma sign chronicity small bowel mri day later came back completely normal sign inflammation damage stool sample showed normal calprotectin level infection also noticeable symptom aside ulcer course abdominal pain diarrhea nothing feeling great ever since recovered ulcer last year however potential reason ulcer terminal ileum gi doc understandably leaning towards attributing crohn gave couple option another colonoscopy month check status ulcer get another data point potentially resolve ended due unknown infection cause situation get worse start biologic suggested skyrizi check fully healed sure plan would suspect would continued monitoring start skyrizi another colonoscopy month option basically assumes crohn sort medication rest life leaning towards option think feel better starting medication another data point supporting likely crohn case start symptom said call right away get another scope medication asap much risk delaying bit know unusual case little hard coming term fact might crohn never experienced symptom also strange happening although read lateonset crohn definitely possible wanted post see thought might going would situation etc thank,Negativo,-0.9843,Neutro

Skin Problems,"So back in August above t two weeks after an infliximab infusion I got a strange rash on my upper chest I thought it was folliculitis because I had it happen before and this looked similar Went to urgent care was prescribed the antibiotics that helped before but it didnt go away We tried another round of antibiotics we tried an antifungal ointment and neither of those things work so I made an appointment with my dermatologist Just before my next Remicade infusion it appeared to subside Two weeks later the rash showed up in new places mostly on my legs and abdomen I saw my PCP who questioned it being a reaction to Remicade I saw my GI doctor who agreed the Remicade could potentially be causing it but she suggested I keep my appointment with dermatology and get a skin biopsy I saw derm and she didnt think a biopsy was necessary She thought it was most likely eczema She prescribed triamcinolone ointment That seemed to clear it up before I had another Remicade infusion but once again two weeks later the rash came back I messaged my dermatologist and started using the ointment again but it was like playing wackamole bc new spots kept popping up This time the dermatologist wanted to do a biopsy Biopsy showed folliculitis no bacterial infection no virus no fungus Because I am pregnant my dermatologist did not want to continue the steroid ointment and I was prescribed clindamycin and told to use benzoyl peroxide wash It only got worse Red bumpy scaly dry extremely itchy At this point the rash was all over my back chest torso legs and on my neck and scalp The dermatologist said I could again try the triamcinolone for just a week It cleared a lot up but there were still new bumps lots of red scaley patches and old spots reappeared so she had me do one more week After that week it looked a lot better not completely gone but again due to pregnancy we stopped Its been a week and it is getting bad again 

I am getting so frustrated Its been months now of not having normal clear skin We still dont know for sure what it is Last time I saw my dermatologist she said that she thinks its a mix of folliculitis and eczema and to just use lots of moisturizer which is doing nothing to help and the rash continues to get worse I have tried to do as much research as I can online and I keep finding that psoriasis matches my experience but my dermatologist has never even mentioned it and I feel like psoriasis isnt so rare that it would be overlooked but the rash is just SO persistent It goes away to an extent with the steroid but comes right back when we stop the steroid My GI doctor discontinued Remicade and is trying to get auth for Stelara 

I dont even know what specifically to ask about anymore Im just at the point where I am upset that Im halfway through a pregnancy and cant relax and enjoy and look at my bump and have the kind of appreciation that I did with my body during my previous pregnancy I feel like Im getting robbed of the experience Im tired of what I see when I look in the mirror Im tired of worrying Im tired of false hope I just want to know what is going on and how I stop it or if I can stop it Or do I have to live with it forever

Current Conditions

 Nonocular Stickler Syndrome Type  Genetic connective tissue disorder
    I have had this since birth but this has only been really studied in the last  years and wasnt diagnosed with it until my early s
 High Blood Pressure
    I have had high blood pressure since I was  tested extensively and one of the best doctors Cardiologist I have ever seen concluded the cause is most likely neurological I am currently on medication to control this
 Crohns Disease
    I will get into this in my explanation near the bottom of the post I think my medical history and timeline of when things happened is very important relating to what may have caused and is causing this disease in me 

  
Past Conditions

 Traumatic Brain Injury TBI
    This resulted from a severe concussion at  in high school football There is a lot of history with this but this injury resulted in the following issues
 Occipital Neuralgia Chronic head pain related to inflamed nerves
    Inflammation of the occipital nerves in the back of the head This caused chronic pain for nearly a decade in the form of a never ending migraine This head pain skyrocketed my blood pressure to critical levels and landed me in the ER many times The highest blood pressure reading I got when I dealt with this pain was  the firefighter told me I shouldve been stroking out
 Severe Depression
    This is difficult for me to talk about because I tried to unalive myself many times I have overcome this state twice in my life The first time was because of a side effect to the medicine Gabapentin I was on Gabapentin because near the end of my severe concussion my brain was healing but misfiring nerve signals causing my legs to go numb The second time was due to the chronic pain and changes in blood pressure medication I couldnt see a way out of the chronic pain and the one escape I started to see was ending my life

  
This is only a brief summary of my conditions Im going to layout the timeline because I think it is very important in how certain conditions manifestedstarted 



Timeline

Going back to winter of  and spring of  I received an injury from wrestling that pulled muscles and potentially affected my nerves in my neck I was treated by a crappy doctor that pushed opioids and made the issue worse My parents had me stop seeing that doctor and instead brought me to a chiropractor who fixed this issue in about  weeks Because of the crappy doctor I missed the entire wrestling season my th grade year 



In the early summer of  I was diagnosed with high blood pressure at  years old I underwent testing but nothing else was found to be wrong My primary at the time wrote it off as hormonal and that I should grow out of it My high blood pressure was soon put on the backburner when later that summer I got a severe concussion from a high school football practice This concussion was so severe it was a TBI and lasted  months before my brain was healing I say healing because in hindsight my concussion was not treated how it shouldve been and it was misfiring nerve signals causing my legs to go numb I was put on Gabapentin which gave feeling back to my legs but upon stopping the medication I became severely depressed

  
I dont plan on talking about my severe depression much because I dont like remembering those memories but I tried to commit many times I was actually put in outpatient care and was put on suicide watch at school Freshman year was awful I eventually overcame this through immense effort and self reflection Trying to live in the now rather than focus on the past or future Living for others that loved me even though I didnt love myself Shortly after overcoming this I developed intense headaches that never ceased and only varied in intensity This persisted most of my Sophomore year of high school until getting nerve blocking injections all around my head This miraculously stopped the pain and my junior and senior year of high school I got to experience being healthy and being a normal teenager I certainly made up for lost time

  
In  I started my first semester as a freshman of Purdue University I had a couple accidents where in about  weeks I had hit my head multiple times The pain came back I was unsure if it was the same pain or a new concussion It couldve been both but I didnt have a good baseline During this time is when I hit my all time high for blood pressure  because head pain increases your blood pressure and high blood pressure can increase head pain This is when I took medical leave from Purdue and started seeing a new neurologist This neurologist was the worst doctor I have ever had as he misdiagnosed me with an inoperable brain tumor I did a spinal tap just to find out it was not cancerous This is when my parents and I decided to get a second opinion and went to Mayo Clinic

  
At Mayo Clinic they found I never had a tumor and that the pain was most likely nerve related and caused by the TBI They did psychological testing to show this was not being made up as some have accused me of They then tried many medicines and treatments but nothing worked I eventually left this doctor and started learning how to function so I could return to school and get my degree which I did During my years of college I had another period of severe depression when I didnt see an end to the pain and underwent changes to blood pressure medication This is also when I saw one of the best doctors I have ever seen who was the head of Cardiology of Rileys Children Hospital at the time After exhausting extensive testing including Stickler Syndrome related issues and other specialists including kidney he concluded this was beyond his expertise and that it was most likely neurological At this point my blood pressure was under control Before graduating a doctor at an ER thought my pain was Occipital Neuralgia and was shortly diagnosed with that condition not long after A treatment I found that helped the pain was Cranial Sacral Massage Therapy Cannabishemp was also one of the only things that actually took my pain away even though it was short term and didnt always take it away completely I eventually got my bachelors degree from Purdue University after years of pain in  

  
My Occipital Neuralgia and High Blood Pressure continued to be an issue until December of  I found a place called NeuroHealth where they used newer therapies including eye coordination movements red laser therapy vagus nerve stimulation chiropractic and a Gyrostim machine This was intensive brain therapy but the most helpful things were the combination of the red laser therapy shown at the base of my skull on the back of my head while shocking my vagus nerve to reset my nervous system My chronic pain which I had dealt with for nearly  years straight and was told it would last the rest of my life was gone in  days This brain therapy was a week long from am to pm every day My pain came back once but after being seen one more time the pain has stayed gone

  
This is where my Crohns issues starts

  
Following the Intensive Brain Therapy in December of  I stopped taking Amitriptyline This medication was mostly for my head and slightly for my mental health In February of  I started to have stomach issues shortly after starting my new job at a bank At first I thought it was a stomach bug but then it persisted I was tested for infections bacteria etc but nothing was coming back Finally I saw a GI and pushed for a colonoscopy  endoscopy The double probe was done and the GI found mild inflammation in the colon He suspected Crohns so he put me on a modified diet and did a fecal sample He still thought I might have IBS and not Crohns He started by putting me back on Amitriptyline citing it being a traditional approach to treating gut issues It did nothing



My GI then wanted me to go on an  week Prednisone taper stating that if this helped me I had Crohns and would then be put on a biologic The taper helped significantly I was able to DoorDash more and more I was working up to manage full time hours so I could know when I would be able to handle a career again I got Covid and Bronchitis during this time but the bathroom trips and stomach pain started to ease Shortly after finishing the Prednisone taper I was approved for Humira

  
I took my first dose of Humira January nd of  and had a rare side effect reaction I became extremely fatigued sleeping  hours a day and my arms and legs have a pulsing feeling where they feel extremely weak and numb I have seen my primary gone to the ER and seen my GI The ER neurologist was concerned about demyelinating disease where the protective coating around the nerves is damaged I was told these feelings would go away when Humira was out of my system It is currently  and these symptoms have not eased or gone away They have remained consistent

  
I just saw my GIs assistant not sure why the GI didnt see me after having the reaction to Humira I am not allowed to take Humira anymore and I had to push to test how much is still in my system If Humira is out of my system then how bad did it mess me up to still feel this way If it is not out of my system then maybe these symptoms will go away when it is finally gone I also pushed for a nutrition panel to see where my vitamin levels are and will be doing another calprotectin fecal sample within the next month I have no medication to treat Crohns and after a year my GI has flipped his view  times now saying it might or might not be Crohns even after diagnosing me with it

  
I have had my fair share of bad doctors and this guy feels like one of them The constant flipping for whether I have Crohns or not after a year seems ridiculous to me Ill list my symptoms below and would like feedback on if this really does sound like Crohns or not I feel like my GI is ignoring my medical history and doesnt answer my questions 

  
Current Symptoms

 Stomach pain where the small intestines are
    I had inflammationpain in my stomach as well but that has gone away mostly after the Prednisone Taper
 Weight loss
    Before the Prednisone Taper I lost enough to be declared anemic and malnourished Gained a lot back with increased appetite from the steroid but am losing weight again since being off of it and Humira
 Extraintestinal inflammation
    This is completely random but the spot it keeps happening is right above my right eye It inflames to the point where it forces my right eye shut and I have to take Benadryl to make it stop My mom told me my entire right side of the face was swollen one of those times This seems to happen more frequently when Ive been sick I have pictures of the eye inflammation I can try attaching if requested Ive been told possible allergic reaction but again its random and nothing is introduced to react to
 Frequent bathroom trips
    I have good days and bad days my diet is super bland but I spend hours in the bathroom everyday I got  times a day on average right now
 Fatigue
    Since taking Humira my fatigue has become extreme
 NumbnessWeakness in arms and legs
    Timing suggests this was also a rare side effect to Humira

  
My personal theory

I think I have central nervous system dysfunction that is causing my High Blood Pressure and digestive issues whether it is Crohns or not Specifically the Vagus nerve since it regulates the cardiovascular and digestive systems in the body 

  
Other theories include having this issue for far longer but the Amitriptyline I was one hid it or kept it at bay There is a correlation between multiple Covid infections and the onset of autoimmune issues There is also the possibility of some genetic cause or malnutritionmalabsorption 

  
I personally do not think it is coincidence that I had Vagus nerve stimulation only to develop these issues a few weeks after I think Humira affecting my nervous system may be related I could be wrong but I am advocating for myself and it logically makes sense given my history







Overall I would like feedback Has anyone else had similar or the same experiences in terms of conditions symptoms side effects experiences with doctors etc What advice do you have in general I am currently unable to work and am struggling to function normally despite my GI saying if it is Crohns its mild like it makes my quality of life seem less awful I have said that if this is mild then Id hate to see moderatesevere I dont even want to get started on this GI brushing off my concerns about depression and then putting me on medication that has negatively impacted my mental health

Should I go to Urgent Care/ER now?,"Hi all

  
Im new to this forumcommunity and Reddit in general so apologies if Im not posting in the most appropriate fashion

  
For background I was misdiagnosed with UC about  years ago and was treated for that with a variety of Mesalamine treatments on two ends Then about  years ago I had an abscessfistula and the DX changed to unspecific Crohns and I was immediately switched to combo therapy with Imuran and Inflectra generic Remicade It worked immediately I felt a normal I hadnt experienced as an adult It was terrific and worked for  years 

  
This past summer I spoke with my Gi and asked if I would need to stay on these medications forever as I understood they were both immunosuppresants and that made me a little nervous especially whenever Id see my irregular blood work My doctor said he felt like I was in a long deep remission and it would be possible to discontinue the Imuran at least temporarily just to see if anything changed I was nervous about doing so and took my time waited about  months before stopping

  
About  month after I stopped the Imuran I started noticing irregularities I immediately contacted my doctor and he ordered a calprotectin sample which showed inflammation I got my next infusion and felt mostly better but continued contacting him and asking if I should get back on the Imuran This was in November about  months ago now His office set up an appointment for me to see him in March as that is the next availability he has 

  
My doctor never gave me a response to the question about Imuran He ordered bloodwork to see if my body was still responding to the Inflectra I was nervous to get that as he was so unresponsive I felt like I would get the result and no explanation I spoke with a few other doctors and they suggested if I was feeling mostly normal having normal BMs and able to be activework then I should not stress out and get test after test to show my doctor something was wrong The response was basically this is as bad as you feel and if you feel ok you can wait until your doctor is available

  
Last week got very bad I went from questioning as to whether I was in a flare to knowing for certain Any of the symptoms I felt might have been bad turned as bad as possible This is the worst Ive been in  years I let my doctor know about it and after about a week he sent me a one month course of prednisone The prednisone may or may not be working Im really not sure 

  
Meanwhile Im scheduled to have another infusion just after a consultation with my doctor in a week His office was able to find a cancelation A week after that Im scheduled to have a colonoscopy The issue is I feel very sick right now I dont know if I can really manage to wait  weeks to even know whats going on 



I feel neglected and mistreated by my doctors I knew something was wrong before it got this bad and still nobody did anything but try and calm my nerves down Nobody took a look nobody felt any urgency to try and answer my questions other than to order tests they didnt make a priority of following up on or explaining to me 

  
I had the worst day of this flare yesterday The prednisone made my BMs extremely hard and dry which was uncomfortable and somewhat painful to pass I could not bring myself to eat more than a few bites of bread and a banana and just drank tons of water 

  
I could explain more but I feel like Ive given a pretty clear picture Do any of you with experience like mine feel like I should wait until the scheduled appointments over the next week or just go in and insist urgent caresomeone treat me immediately I would much rather start working on getting better than seeing how much worse things can get but I sincerely dont know what to do",2025-01-27 16:14:55,702,hi new forumcommunity general apology posting appropriate fashion background misdiagnosed uc year ago treated variety mesalamine treatment two end year ago abscessfistula dx changed unspecific crohn immediately switched combo therapy imuran inflectra generic remicade worked immediately felt normal experienced adult terrific worked year past summer spoke gi asked would need stay medication forever understood immunosuppresants made little nervous especially whenever see irregular blood work doctor said felt like long deep remission would possible discontinue imuran least temporarily see anything changed nervous took time waited month stopping month stopped imuran started noticing irregularity immediately contacted doctor ordered calprotectin sample showed inflammation got next infusion felt mostly better continued contacting asking get back imuran november month ago office set appointment see march next availability doctor never gave response question imuran ordered bloodwork see body still responding inflectra nervous get unresponsive felt like would get result explanation spoke doctor suggested feeling mostly normal normal bm able activework stress get test test show doctor something wrong response basically bad feel feel ok wait doctor available last week got bad went questioning whether flare knowing certain symptom felt might bad turned bad possible worst year let doctor know week sent one month course prednisone prednisone may may working really sure meanwhile scheduled another infusion consultation doctor week office able find cancelation week scheduled colonoscopy issue feel sick right know really manage wait week even know whats going feel neglected mistreated doctor knew something wrong got bad still nobody anything try calm nerve nobody took nobody felt urgency try answer question order test make priority following explaining worst day flare yesterday prednisone made bm extremely hard dry uncomfortable somewhat painful pas could bring eat bite bread banana drank ton water could explain feel like given pretty clear experience like mine feel like wait scheduled appointment next week go insist urgent caresomeone treat immediately would much rather start working getting better seeing much worse thing get sincerely know,Negativo,-0.9882,Negativo

Second Opinion on Potential Crohn’s Diagnosis: Seeking Advice,"Hey all 

So Ill keep it as short as I can In July I was hospitalized with intense pain in the epigastrium but no diarrhea Two days later I underwent a colonoscopy because my CRP levels were at  They discovered some ulcers in my terminal ileum The doctor suspected Crohns but the biopsy was clear and my symptoms were absolutely atypical so he couldnt make a diagnosis As a result he prescribed me Pentasa just in case and told me to follow up with him after  months

Three months later my CRP had dropped to  and my blood test results were absolutely normal He advised me to continue taking Pentasa for another three months after which we would reassess my condition In the meantime I havent experienced any symptoms at all except for some slight pain in the epigastrium here and there after consuming spicy foods or drinking milk Also  weeks before now my CRP was again at 

Today I visited another specialist to get a second opinion Here are the most important points he raised

Performing a colonoscopy two days after being hospitalized was a major mistake He explained that an acute episode like gastroenteritis or similar conditions can also cause temporary inflammation that mimics Crohns He mentioned having encountered such cases before

A decrease in CRP from  to  within a few months without medication he attributes only a  chance of Pentasa healing ileum cases is nearly impossible

To sum it up my new doctor believes there is a strong possibility that I dont have Crohns However he cant rule it out completely yet He recommended another blood test and a calprotectin test If the results are normal he plans to take me off Pentasa to exclude the possibility that the drug is responsible for healing my gut If not he will suggest another colonoscopy

How common is it to fail multiple biologics and still have success with medication?

Twisted bowel,"So yesterday I woke up in excruciating pain It got a bit better but not that much so off to the ER I went
Thankfully I was already at the ER when my pain got so much worse so I had proper pain management
I had a hysterectomy a year ago but they still wanted to blame my female parts for my pain and send me to OB where all they found were edema and fluid around my small intestine Sent me back to the ER and they wanted to send me home but offered me to stay and have a CT in the morning 
I chose to stay and had the CT at  am this morning Turns out my small intestine are twisted and now I am waiting to be admitted for further testing
What really grinds my gears is me complaining about this area to my GI many times asking him to have it checked out with imaging but been repeatedly told no since my colonoscopy was clear  I have lost  kg in the last  months and been unable to eat due to this

Stelara Causing Constipation 25M,"Hi Guys I thought Id share this bizarre side effect of Stelara that I keep facing and any recommendations on any stool softeners available from my local chemist

So Ive been on stelara for about  years its been honestly a miraculous medicine for me as it pretty much has me in remissionto an extent atleast So for about the last  years Ive been facing this bizzare side effect from stelara which I have seen in this subreddit before constipation from Stelara So for you to understand how I definitely know its the stelara I did my own study in no way am I condoning this 

I have spoken to my Specialist who done an endocolonoscopy blood test with no signs of trouble which had led me to test whether this may be a stelara side effectnot listed on the website

I dose stelara every  weeks 

st week after dosingIntense constipation I need to sit like a frog on the toilet seat to have it come out and it literally bleeds and when it comes out its HUGE and in one peice with different colours LOL

nd weekstool is still very tough not as bad as week  but because of the tarehemorrhoids it makes it so difficult to pass stool And instigates the hemorrhoids which bleed and looks like a murder in the toilet bowl

rd week Stool becomes softer and the hemorrhoids start to recover and by week   week  stool becomes softer and more consistent Than obviously my test was to not dose for an extra  weeks than I can feel the crohns symptoms coming back with the diorreah restarting and the cramping beginning I got scared dosed and than BOOM the timeline restartsI know not a smart idea to do but I got desperate

This cycle has been so consistent that Ive had a colonoscopy endoscopy to rule out something more dreadful but all is Normal just inflammatory markers are slightly elevated but thats due to my hemorrhoids I really dont want to get off Stelara as there is no pain associated with crohns its just more so the side effect of intense constipation which makes it so unpleasant

Any recommendations of stool softeners really goes a long way Im in Sydney Aus And if anyone is experiencing something similar I would like to hear how you cope with it",2025-01-27 02:56:07,399,hi guy thought share bizarre side effect stelara keep facing recommendation stool softener available local chemist stelara year honestly miraculous medicine pretty much remissionto extent atleast last year facing bizzare side effect stelara seen constipation stelara understand definitely know stelara study way condoning spoken specialist done endocolonoscopy blood test sign trouble led test whether may stelara side effectnot listed website dose stelara every week st week dosingintense constipation need sit like frog toilet seat come literally bleeds come huge one peice different colour nd weekstool still tough bad week tarehemorrhoids make difficult pas stool instigates hemorrhoid bleed like murder toilet bowl rd week stool becomes softer hemorrhoid start recover week week stool becomes softer consistent obviously test dose extra week feel crohn symptom coming back diorreah restarting cramping beginning got scared dosed boom timeline restartsi know smart idea got desperate cycle consistent colonoscopy endoscopy rule something dreadful normal inflammatory marker slightly elevated thats due hemorrhoid really want get stelara pain associated crohn side effect intense constipation make unpleasant recommendation stool softener really go long way sydney au anyone experiencing something similar would like hear cope,Negativo,-0.9821,Negativo

Switching biologicals to hit deductible?,"Many of you are facing the same issue Im facing this year where your insurance has rejected Humira from your insurance plan  They want us to start taking Amjevita or Hadlima two bio similar drugs that are cheaper

Since these are bio similar is there any reason our doctors cant or shouldnt switch our script mid year to the other drug This would allow us to combine the two co pay card benefits and hopefully only have  to pay max  If they are truly bio similars then the risk of building antibiotics should be the same as leaving Humira in the first place

I've had Crohns/UC for 10 Years and I Need Help,"Hey everyone This is my first post here because I am not sure where else to turn for some advice and recommendations from individuals who struggle with the same disease I am a  yo F and for the past four years I have been battling to keep my disease in remission with little or no success I have been hospitalized  or  times in the last four years with the worst case being a bowel obstruction A part of my colon was almost removed twice and I had antibiotics to recover from appendicitis twice as well I have had an anal fistula surgery when I was younger and I have some strictures in my GI tract from damage in the past My ESR number has fluctuated from  all the way to  and even higher and my calprotectin has seen the  markers

Trying to keep this as short as possible  but at the end of  I thought my fight was over when I was finally swapped to Rinvoq mg x mg dose tablets per day Rinvoq worked incredible for this past year of  I was going on runs again outside lifting heavier weights than I ever had before at the gym enjoying green tea and the occasional coffee again never alcohol or smoking I was even able to reintroduce simple or blended fruits and vegetables back into my diet I didnt feel scared anymore of eating one wrong food item and ending up back in urgent care or worse for a stay

For some reason even though there has been no dietary changes no alcohol no smoking no high fiber foods everything you are NOT supposed to do with our disease I am experiencing a flare up again that has been ongoing since mid december  until now as I type this My ESR number is shooting back up into the s again calprotectin above  and I had to go to the ER where I was prescribed prednisone and now budesonide steroids at a mg dosage per day Worst of all I had another CT scan done that shows a cm length stricture of the distal ileum and terminal ileum with acute hyperenhancement and another cm length shorter segment stricture of the distal ileal loops noted slightly to the left of the midline I can feel these when I try going to the gym or working out and it has halted my progress for now trying to do anything high intensity

For full context I have failed Remicade Humira Stelara Entyvio entyvio I only gave  months  my diet was reduced to plain rice and chicken and I felt nothing on entyvio and now potentially rinvoq At this point Im at a bit of a loss on what to even do I continue to work with my doctor and there is a potential she will want to switch me to Skyrizi soon but we havent discussed the CT scan results Even then for four years now I have been living with these strictures around my colon and they have genuinely degraded the quality of my life by so much I like to think that this disease has made me a stronger person because of what I have had to endure but at what point is it worth it to remove sections of my colon to improve my quality of life Does anyone have any experience with something similar to this failing medications or any general advice

I would love to get into more details of my full diet and supplement routine I was taking while Rinvoq was working amazingly but I dont want to make this post too long I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this far I have been in a big mental slump recently just wondering when the pain will end and what I might be doing wrong If anyone has any home remedies or recommendations for the healing of the strictures as well please let me know Thank you",2025-01-25 23:17:29,676,hey everyone first post sure else turn advice recommendation individual struggle disease f past four year battling keep disease remission little success hospitalized time last four year worst case bowel obstruction part colon almost removed twice antibiotic recover appendicitis twice anal fistula surgery younger stricture gi tract damage past esr number fluctuated way even higher calprotectin seen marker trying keep short possible end thought fight finally swapped rinvoq mg x mg dose tablet per day rinvoq worked incredible past year going run outside lifting heavier weight ever gym enjoying green tea occasional coffee never alcohol smoking even able reintroduce simple blended fruit vegetable back diet feel scared anymore eating one wrong food item ending back urgent care worse stay reason even though dietary change alcohol smoking high fiber food everything supposed disease experiencing flare ongoing since mid december type esr number shooting back calprotectin go er prescribed prednisone budesonide steroid mg dosage per day worst another ct scan done show cm length stricture distal ileum terminal ileum acute hyperenhancement another cm length shorter segment stricture distal ileal loop noted slightly left midline feel try going gym working halted progress trying anything high intensity full context failed remicade humira stelara entyvio entyvio gave month diet reduced plain rice chicken felt nothing entyvio potentially rinvoq point bit loss even continue work doctor potential want switch skyrizi soon discussed ct scan result even four year living stricture around colon genuinely degraded quality life much like think disease made stronger person endure point worth remove section colon improve quality life anyone experience something similar failing medication general advice would love get detail full diet supplement routine taking rinvoq working amazingly want make post long appreciate anyone taken time read far big mental slump recently wondering pain end might wrong anyone home remedy recommendation healing stricture please let know thank,Negativo,-0.7218,Neutro

Complications post colectomy,"I had a colectomy with IRA last week and was discharged on PO day  having BMs about x day I returned to the hospital on PO day  because the gas in my abdomen and chest had barely subsided if at all and because my BMs had slowed down to  a day with no urgency and barely any substance Im talking drips

My CT scan with the ER doctors report says the following Diffuse mildtomoderate dilatation of air and fluidfilled bowel abdomen  likely due to postoperative ileus and Mild diffuse small bowel and rectal wall thickening suggestive of  enterocolitisdiarrheal state This makes me believe its an ileus but the resident staff sent me home the next day saying the large amount of gas in my small intestines is normal and that it just needs time to pass They only prescribed miralax once a day


My pain from the gas has not subsided and I find that it starts low at the beginning of the day and then gets worse throughout the day till it is fairly unbearable at night I am still having barely any BMs and not passing much gas Im convinced this is an ileus and needs to be treated as such but even my surgeon said over the phone that he doesnt think its that since Im still passing some stool and am not throwing up 

Im wondering if anyone has experienced anything like this and what their treatment washow did it resolve Im also curious if its possible this is an ileus since there is no vomiting and still some although very little and few BMs The unrelenting gas pain just makes me think it must be but Im not sure if there are cases of ileus like this Maybe SIBO

Fell out with a family member after a particularly bad night with my crohns and I just need to vent about it,"I posted here venting a couple of days ago but I need to do it again since its related to my crohns to a degree that I dont think someone without it would understand

TMI I know but last night I had blood pouring out of me Literally just blood and also some clots I mean Ive been diagnosed for  years and Ive never had just blood coming out of me in that quantity before Obviously maybe not obviously I confided in my mum about it because it felt bizarre and I was confused and also Im sorry but there looked like there was so much blood that I thought my behind was the elevator from the shining it scared me It was like that all night and yeah eventually the blood stopped I mean we only have so much right But it scared me and it was a really bad night Everythings sore Im always in pain and Im always exhausted but I feel it doubly so today  
Ive rang my IBD nurses so its fine

Now today despite knowing the sort of night I had my mum decided to blow up on me out of nowhere I mean we were fine and then a couple of hours later she blows up and tells me that Im selfish and Im taking advantage of her because Im sick I dont ask her for anything I dont expect anything from her I feel like a burden honestly Im  years old I live alone and I used to work  hours a week cook clean and manage my own life Now I can barely get out of bed most days because I physically cant move and Im in so much pain and now instead of going on nights out or doing things other people in their s are I sleep all day and sit on the toilet all night Theres an entire half of my family who dont believe I have crohns because they cant see it and therefore they think Im exaggerating it In fact they preemptively told me that they wouldnt be doing anything for me this flare up when I hadnt asked or expected them to So really the only person I have is my mum I love her a lot and Im grateful and thankful to have her and I appreciate all that she does for me but she genuinely believes Im either lying about that or I only feel those things because Im taking advantage of her 

A few months ago she was diagnosed with diverticulitis It sucks for her I know it does Its horrible to be unwell and to have to adjust Its horrible to have tests done to find out whats wrong Theyre doing tests to make sure its just diverticulitis and not anything else like cancer Thats scary too I know it is Ive tried my best to be an emotional support for her Ive asked her how she feels about everything thats been saideverything thats going on Every time we talk I start the conversation by asking how shes feeling and how her symptoms are and I try to give advice whenever I can lets not take nsaids lets hydrate more today etc and thats all I can do but I really really do genuinely try as best as I can to make sure that she knows I care Ive been downplaying my own condition and how its making me feel because I dont want to add on to her stress 

She has her partner and my sibling but she told me that Im the only that listens or asks about it And today shes told me that Im just as bad as them because I never ask if theres anything I can do for her I mean Id like to be able to ask and maybe shes right and it is selfish of me but I dont because I wouldnt be able to do anything In my last post I wrote about how I put my washing in the machine and I dont put it on for a week because my energy is gone just sorting and loading it all and thats not even counting how long it takes to put it away I let my washing up pile up for a few days then wash it all in one big go when Im feeling up to it instead of kneeling over the sink heaving in pain to wash up one or two dishes straight after eating I just dont think its in my bounds to provide any kind of tangible support like offering to clean someones house or offering to go to places and do things when I cant even do them for myself But I do my best to be there emotionally and to just listen or provide some advice every now and then But its not good enough apparently and its not just that She feels like Im selfish and taking advantage and Im not making enough effort because shell do things for me I get around to doing things in my own time and I feel entitled to do that when Im sick I have no energy and its not harming anyone in the house I live in and pay for alone but if she sees it needs doing then shell do it I always tell her that she doesnt need to and thank her and tell her I appreciate it but she feels like Im doing it on purpose even though Im not I mean I push myself to do things some days to the point that Im throwing up and I have to stay in bed for the rest of the week She knows that and not once have I asked her during those times to help me out because I feel like its my responsibility 

I just dont understand and I dont know if me not understanding is the problem here and Im genuinely in the wrong 
Im drained Ive been like this for over a year Ive been waiting for my meds work since September Ive been waiting for my appointment with my GI in a couple of weeks The nurses rang me back and told me that I might need to go into hospital if this bleeding carries on or somehow gets worse Either by going into AE myself lol lmao even or if my consultant wants me to But either way they want me to have a scope to see if theres something more serious happening 
I dont even know if I can tell her honestly Maybe my prides been hurt and maybe thats an indicator that Im in the wrong but Id rather deal with this alone and go into hospital alone than be told that Im selfish for being ill especially when she doubled down and told me she didnt feel bad for saying it She just really knows how to pick the time and occasion is all I know but hey at least its not as bad as being  in a hospital bed and being screamed at for being an inconsiderate daughter so every cloud",2025-01-23 14:02:33,1200,posted venting couple day ago need since related crohn degree think someone without would understand tmi know last night blood pouring literally blood also clot mean diagnosed year never blood coming quantity obviously maybe obviously confided mum felt bizarre confused also sorry looked like much blood thought behind elevator shining scared like night eventually blood stopped mean much right scared really bad night everythings sore always pain always exhausted feel doubly today rang ibd nurse fine today despite knowing sort night mum decided blow nowhere mean fine couple hour later blow tell selfish taking advantage sick ask anything expect anything feel like burden honestly year old live alone used work hour week cook clean manage life barely get bed day physically cant move much pain instead going night thing people sleep day sit toilet night entire half family believe crohn cant see therefore think exaggerating fact preemptively told anything flare asked expected really person mum love lot grateful thankful appreciate genuinely belief either lying feel thing taking advantage month ago diagnosed diverticulitis suck know horrible unwell adjust horrible test done find whats wrong test make sure diverticulitis anything else like cancer thats scary know tried best emotional support asked feel everything thats saideverything thats going every time talk start conversation asking feeling symptom try give advice whenever let take nsaid let hydrate today etc thats really really genuinely try best make sure know care downplaying condition making feel want add stress partner sibling told listens asks today told bad never ask anything mean like able ask maybe right selfish able anything last post wrote put washing machine put week energy gone sorting loading thats even counting long take put away let washing pile day wash one big go feeling instead kneeling sink heaving pain wash one two dish straight eating think bound provide kind tangible support like offering clean someone house offering go place thing cant even best emotionally listen provide advice every good enough apparently feel like selfish taking advantage making enough effort thing get around thing time feel entitled sick energy harming anyone house live pay alone see need always tell need thank tell appreciate feel like purpose even though mean thing day point throwing stay bed rest week know asked time help feel like responsibility understand know understanding problem genuinely wrong drained like year waiting med work since september waiting appointment gi couple week nurse rang back told might need go hospital bleeding carry somehow get worse either going ae lmao even consultant want either way want scope see something serious happening even know tell honestly maybe pride hurt maybe thats indicator wrong rather deal alone go hospital alone told selfish especially doubled told feel bad saying really know pick time occasion know hey least bad hospital bed screamed inconsiderate daughter every cloud,Negativo,-0.9858,Negativo

Need infusion in the Philippines,"Also posted in Crohns and colitis

Hello
   My wife and I are currently living in Northern Luzon Pangasinan  We are both US citizens here on a  year visa  I am on Infliximabdyyb every  weeks  I have to return to the US for my infusion

Can anyone recommend a private hospitalDr where I can get an infusion  Hopefully close to Alaminos City  Perhaps Dagupon or Clark

If the price is less than the cost of round trip tickets hopefully much less then we can just get the infusion done here  Of course I want quality care and safety

I am also on MP daily

Our other options are Manila or even Singapore Guam but the flight is painful

Any suggestions or thoughts are appreciated

I urgently need advice,"I am literally squirming I am not sure what to do This is going to be lengthy so if you read all of this THANK YOU I have been seeing my current GI since  When I first started going to this practice I gave them a  star review I thought they were great However looking back I believe there were some red flags To keep things short I am just going to list things out in chronological order 



Start seeing them sometime  They refused to do a colonoscopy on me because I had one done about  years prior that was normal They did go ahead and move forward with an EGD



Keep having follow ups explaining I am not feeling better and their recommendations are not working They tell me to keep up with the fiber take the antispasmodic for cramping and to fu as needed



Follow up  after going to the hospital and being diagnosed with diverticulitis I was on antibiotics for  days They finally scheduled me for a colonoscopy



 I had the colposcopy and am diagnosed with Crohns disease They told me they had to remove a polyp and they biopsied ulcers in my terminal ileum and explained some bleeding would be normal Said I did not have diverticulitis but it was actually Crohns that sent me to the hospital



Later that night I ended up in the hospital due to excessive blood loss where I spent the next  days One of the ulcers that were biopsied had started bleeding uncontrollably I had to undergo two more colonoscopies and two preps for them to resolve the issue They had to put clips on the bleeding ulcer



Follow up with the doctor and he says thats just bad luck and that is the last time I saw him for an appointment All my care has been handled by his PA since then 



I did have one more colonoscopy after being on Skyrizi April  for a year and was told I was in remission 

  
In October I followed up because I was pooping out oil Like every BM I would have loads of oil floating in the toilet The PA said thats weird I dont have an answer for you after running two tests that came back normal I think they checked my liver and checked for EPI and would not do further testing



 Fast forward to today I have been out of work all week because of a Crohns flare I was already feeling bad last week and this week was horrible I reached out to my GI Monday saying I was really unwell They told me to hold off on doing my biologic injection I was supposed to take it Monday and to come in to pick up stool test kits they want to rule out an infection



 Things quickly deteriorate since not doing the injection Trace amounts of blood mucus diarrhea stomach pain fevers and low grade fevers I reached out to my GI for a note for work since I have been out all week My GI responded I dont know why you have been out of work all week Your lab appointment to pick up the stool kit was  minutes max You did not need a whole day off work for that

  


 Explained why I have been out of work fevers diarrhea urgency stomach pain cramping All that Which I already explained in my initial message that prompted the stool tests She says she can only provide a note for the lab appointment and she will not excuse me from work She said I would need to go to my PCP for that Oh and she has decided it is now okay for me to take my injection even though she does not have the results of the stool test to rule out an intestinal infection



Start kicking around the idea of finding a new GI so I went to my records in my chart so I can go ahead and start printing them off to take to the new practice This is when I discover that all my other records are available but the colonoscopy from  the one that put me in the hospital is not available My most recent colonoscopy is available but not the problematic one Which I think is extremely fishy



I sent them a message saying that I was reviewing my documents and I didnt see the colonoscopy for  That was the colonoscopy that diagnosed me with Crohns disease so I certainly want to take that with me to my next GI but I told them I just want that for my records I am waiting for their reply Anyway I am definitely shopping around for a new GI I just dont want them to know because I am scared they will discharge me as a patient and cancel all my biologic refills on file 



Also I do have the paper copies that they gave me on  for the botched colonoscopy So I do have proof that it happened I am just waiting to see what they say about it Anyways I just wanted to vent about this Not only are they not being compassionate about the condition they are treating me for but they are also at least negligent on uploading proper documentation on the patient portals At most they are trying to hide that procedure ever occurred 



If you have made it this far what do you do when you are in a flare and cant get in with your GI for a note I feel like they should be the ones to supply it not my PCP They are the ones who  diagnosed the disease  are treating me for the disease  told me NOT to take my medication which further resulted in symptoms Am I thinking about this the wrong way",2025-01-22 20:32:39,993,literally squirming sure going lengthy read thank seeing current gi since first started going practice gave star review thought great however looking back believe red flag keep thing short going list thing chronological order start seeing sometime refused colonoscopy one done year prior normal go move forward egd keep follow ups explaining feeling better recommendation working tell keep fiber take antispasmodic cramping fu needed follow going hospital diagnosed diverticulitis antibiotic day finally scheduled colonoscopy colposcopy diagnosed crohn disease told remove polyp biopsied ulcer terminal ileum explained bleeding would normal said diverticulitis actually crohn sent hospital later night ended hospital due excessive blood loss spent next day one ulcer biopsied started bleeding uncontrollably undergo two colonoscopy two prep resolve issue put clip bleeding ulcer follow doctor say thats bad luck last time saw appointment care handled pa since one colonoscopy skyrizi april year told remission october followed pooping oil like every bm would load oil floating toilet pa said thats weird answer running two test came back normal think checked liver checked epi would testing fast forward today work week crohn flare already feeling bad last week week horrible reached gi monday saying really unwell told hold biologic injection supposed take monday come pick stool test kit want rule infection thing quickly deteriorate since injection trace amount blood mucus diarrhea stomach pain fever low grade fever reached gi note work since week gi responded know work week lab appointment pick stool kit minute max need whole day work explained work fever diarrhea urgency stomach pain cramping already explained initial message prompted stool test say provide note lab appointment excuse work said would need go pcp oh decided okay take injection even though result stool test rule intestinal infection start kicking around idea finding new gi went record chart go start printing take new practice discover record available colonoscopy one put hospital available recent colonoscopy available problematic one think extremely fishy sent message saying reviewing document see colonoscopy colonoscopy diagnosed crohn disease certainly want take next gi told want record waiting reply anyway definitely shopping around new gi want know scared discharge patient cancel biologic refill file also paper copy gave botched colonoscopy proof happened waiting see say anyways wanted vent compassionate condition treating also least negligent uploading proper documentation patient portal trying hide procedure ever occurred made far flare cant get gi note feel like one supply pcp one diagnosed disease treating disease told take medication resulted symptom thinking wrong way,Negativo,-0.9547,Negativo

Crohn in a small bowel?,"Hi

I am  and Ive been dealing with GI issues for a couple of years Here is my story

Theres been a pain in my upper stomachstomach valve for about eight years It is not like a heartburn as it is more dull The funny thing about it is that it appears every  seven days and it lasts for one day Because of that problem I had four gastroscopies year after year

st There was a mm spot of inflammation in my stomach

Then I was tested for helicobacter and it was a positive test I eradicated that bacteria

nd There was some mild stomach inflammation  stripes

rd There were some erosions in my duodenum

th The last gastroscopy came out clean

I had Colon Hydrotherapy and after that my intestines started to produce a lot of sounds  gurgling  and its been like that for months I had a positive fecal occult blood test and I had a colonoscopy which was clear I was tested for SIBO and my test was positive I used Rifaximin with no improvement in my condition despite a strict lowFODMAP diet I have a lot of gas

Recently I had appendectomy due to the acute appendix inflammation I also developed one external hemorrhoid shortly after that

My current situation is  that in addition to the mentioned recurrent upper stomachstomach valve pain I have very loud intestine sounds which I mentioned about Sometimes I have lower quadrant and belly button area pain I do not experience diarrhea often but sometimes No visible blood on paper

As of the blood work  my CRP and ESR are normal The only marker from blood which was elevated was MPK but after that I had colonoscopy which did not find anything Elevated MPK can be due to the inflammation  though

The only part of my body which was not carefully examined is a small intestine Do you think MRI enterography is a good idea Is CT scan similar and can be used instead of MRI Or maybe a pill cam is a safer option How is a small bowel Crohn diagnosed Is fecal calprotectin level a good indication of the inflammation in the small bowel

Can a small intestine Crohn manifest itself by loud intestine sounds sporadic pain and sporadic diarrhea

I need to admit I am hypochondriac and I suffer from depression

Do you think it may be Crohn or maybe it is all in my head

NSAIDs,"I was diagnosed with Crohns disease  years ago I had an ileocolic resection  years ago and I was on MP for years The past year Ive been on Stelara which has been great and Im finally in remission

Ever since I was diagnosed with Crohns disease Ive avoided NSAIDs nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs because Ive had bad reactions to some Ive broken out with multiple mouth ulcers and possible oesophageal ulcers after having single doses of diclofenac and celecoxib in the past so I basically just avoided all NSAIDs to be safe

My question is does anyone else with Crohns tolerate some NSAIDs ok Prior to being officially diagnosed with Crohns but definitely after I can look back and realise I had symptoms and likely had it I used to take Ibuprofen with no issues

Yesterday I came down with a cold and have a really sore throat Id just finished night shifts and so I was feeling horrible and we have Ibuprofen in the house so I decided to have some because nothing else was helping my sore throat It helped my sore throat significantly and today Ive woken up and I dont have any mouth ulcers or pain in my oesophagus to suggest a reaction to the Ibuprofen And Im wondering my whether Ibuprofen is probably going to be likely to be safe for me to take as an NSAID

I wondered whether it would be related to their inhibition of COX but it doesnt make a lot of sense to me Ibuprofen is a non selective COX inhibitor whereas Diclofenac is a preferential COX  inhibitor and Celecoxib is a selective COX  inhibitor I would have thought that the non selective COX NSAIDs which are more likely to effect GI would mean that something like Ibuprofen would be more likely to cause ulcers",2025-01-22 14:56:24,309,diagnosed crohn disease year ago ileocolic resection year ago mp year past year stelara great finally remission ever since diagnosed crohn disease avoided nsaid nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug bad reaction broken multiple mouth ulcer possible oesophageal ulcer single dos diclofenac celecoxib past basically avoided nsaid safe question anyone else crohn tolerate nsaid ok prior officially diagnosed crohn definitely back realise symptom likely used take ibuprofen issue yesterday came cold really sore throat finished night shift feeling horrible ibuprofen house decided nothing else helping sore throat helped sore throat significantly today woken mouth ulcer pain oesophagus suggest reaction ibuprofen wondering whether ibuprofen probably going likely safe take nsaid wondered whether would related inhibition cox make lot sense ibuprofen non selective cox inhibitor whereas diclofenac preferential cox inhibitor celecoxib selective cox inhibitor would thought non selective cox nsaid likely effect gi would mean something like ibuprofen would likely cause ulcer,Negativo,-0.9675,Neutro

Traumatic colonoscopy,"TW if you have a colonoscopy schedule read at you risk 


This is the story of the worst experience of my life

I was experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms for almost a year 
I decided to go to the doctor and after many exams they decided to give me a colonoscopy 
I was scared shitless or shitfull in my case
Everyone was telling me to relax the worst part is the prep they said 
So I went to the appointment pretty calm  thinking they were gonna drug me pretty hard and everything was gonna be ok 

I was wrong 

First thing first Im welcomed by a very unwelcoming doctor
She told me to get undressed  to sign some papers and to lay down 
After laying down the nurse placed an access in my arm to give me some anesthetic or so I thought 

She gave me something and I was pretty relaxed for the first  minutes  and then Hell got loose

I started to feel EVERYTHING

I was crying  screaming  throwing punches begging the nurse for more drugs 

They gave me NOTHING AT ALL

The doctor had the audacity to be mad at me and screamed at me to stay still or she was going to perforate my bowel 
I wasnt very calm after that 

After what felt like hours the procedure was over and they dressed me while I was still crying and dissociating on the hospital bed  

They put me in a waiting room were i was supposed to wait for the anesthesia to wear down
Btch I was awake and screaming the entire time
Atp I was shacking and unable to calm down after experiencing the worst pain of my life when a LOVELY nurse started staring at me and decided to say omg  if you had to make a scene you could have asked for more anesthetic
WTF bitch I did  The whole hospital probably heard  

Anyway the pain is what I imagine giving birth would be  but after that you have a baby  after this kind of pain I had a Cronh diagnosis

Not cool 

Anyway Im Italian and I was doing this via free healthcare so I think they were kinda stingy with meds because Italian public healthcare system is quite poor

Next time Im going to do it privately and I want them to KNOCK ME OUT COMPLETELY

Entivio after everything else,"My husband has had a rough four years He started out with having prostate issues and fissures So he took the bait and started the infusion journey 

I could see immediately he looked tired and was losing weight He would respond well to the initial treatments but with every brand after multiple treatments he would have a reaction
He started with remicaid and they stopped it because he was going in the wrong direction and it was making his immune system weak Too weak 

The worst reaction was last December mid way through his Stellara  he went code red and was sent to ER They sent him home and two days later he was back in the ER after being sick for two days to wind up with a BLOCKAGE He had emergency surgery and ultimately went home with an illeostomy
He had skyrizi and they also stopped this before he was reconnected because he also had complications to it

Since August hes had it reversed and they want to get him back on infusions
They are proposing 
ENTIVIO

He is terrified and almost hiding from his doctors because he is THAT scared

When he got sick and he had the barriatric surgery and got the Illiostomy he said  I wish I never started this I wish I could go back to when I had fissures  eluding that he was seeking out treatments that are making him feel worse than he ever felt

His doctor admitted the infusions he had were not agreeing with him but they promise that Entivio doesnt target your immune system like the others  but it instead targets your symptoms making it easier to live with Crohns 

He is  and he works Hes strong and in decent shape for the amount of trauma his body has endured

My Rinvoq journey ...,"I got diagnosed with this disease approximately  years ago and am in a flare for longer than that I tried various medications within those  biologics Remicade and Entyvio to be precise and both of those failed me 

  
I tried rinvoq and it game me near instant relief my  toilet rushes got decreased to  times a day sometimes less it felt wonderful even  though my stool was not formed at all  it was better than it was for a long time 

After  weeks of mg i was reduced to mg and the symptoms slowly crept up again Within those symptoms were more blood in the stool again more frequent visits to the toilet again etc while not as bad as before i started rinvoq it was getting worse again weirdly enough my stool consistency became better tho since it became harder not fully hard but harder 

Today I met with the doctor again to discuss options I was hoping that my dosage would be increased to mg again but my doctor said that rinvoq was not intended to be taken at mg for longer than  weeks since it increases the likelyhood of side effects significantly I told him that the leaflet says that mg can be taken for up to  weeks so he reluctantly agreed to increase my dosage to  mg again for another  weeks after that mg again 

  
I am at a loss of words and dont really know what to do while reading on the internet that some doctors even put their patient on mg for significantly longer times than  weeks mine is reluctant to do it even for  while this was the only medication which again gave me a resemblance of life

Something I wrote 4.5 years ago shortly after being diagnosed,"I was going through my Google Docs to find my resume to update and I found this little piece I wrote Its date July  which is a couple months after diagnosis a stint in hospital and while I was still trying to figure out what meds would work best for me 

It was a tough read for me But also kind of comforting as I have come a long way Back pain is no more I have my bad days where I can spend a lot of time in the bathroom But overall bathroom time has improved I still suffer from joint and arthritic pains and no doubt this disease has taken its toll on my mental health 

Not the best writing and probably full of errors I remember I was so mad that day I just got to my PC and started typing 



There it goes again The melody of Apples latest default alarm sound Another day in paradise I reach out to snooze that motherfucker and as soon as I move my arm it begins The sharp stabbing feeling in my midlower back The same pain I have been dealing with for way too long now I want to cry I want to scream I want it to go away Surely this isnt normal Why wont you go to the doctors You need to get this sorted The doctors are expensive I know what is in store Specialist on specialist appointments a couple of hundred dollars each time A lifetime of medicine Fuck that noise Wasting my hard earned money on being healthy No thanks Why would I want to spend money on staying healthy and being alive I didnt choose to be here Id rather spend it on video games or drugs and alcohol But you are in constant pain Yes that is true but Im also terrified about being a sick person Is it not easier just to hide away from your problems and hope they magically disappear

Youve got ten minutes Go back to sleep So I try Using all my effort I roll over close my eyes and try to sneak another ten minutes of sleep in Barely a minute passes and another all too familiar pain begins to take hold Somewhere in my bowel or my gut or maybe its my intestines I feel the embers of a fire start to rage Here comes the bubbling feeling like someone set off a SodaSteam in my stomach Within another minute or two it turns to some nasty cramps similar to what I would imagine taking a corkscrew to the stomach would feel like  My only thought now is how long can I lay here before I shit myself In reality not long at all 

I look towards the bathroom and see my partner is still getting ready I dont want to ruin her day before it even begins by evacuating my bowels while she is putting on makeup I think about going to the downstairs toilet but am hesitant because climbing back up the stairs with a knife in my back doesnt sound so pleasant either I could get ready first then go downstairs to avoid having to come back upstairs but I really dont think Ill be able to hold it in So there I lay weighing up my options Deal with the cramping until my partner is ready or head downstairs Today like most days waiting it out seems like the better option 

Fifteen minutes of uncomfortable tossing and turning and my partner is done I hear the door open and that prompts my slow ascent out of bed I slowly sit up grabbing a handful of the sheets as leverage drag myself to the edge compose myself for a minute then while grabbing onto my chest of drawers accompanied by a huge sigh and grunt I manage to pull myself up

Good morning my dear how did you sleep

Terribly you

Like a baby Your back again

Of course and a couple of pit stops in the middle of the night

I limp towards the toilet and take my place on my throne Wonder how long I will spend on the toilet today This morning shouldnt be too bad as I had to get up twice in the middle of the night to relieve myself Why did you eat so much of that chilli sauce you absolute fuck head I load up Reddit to distract myself from these thoughts while my bowels go to work

In full zombie mode I get my teeth cleaned face washed and manage to put some clothes on I pack my bag and head for the train station There it is again some lovely cramps How is it even possible Ive had three explosions in the last four hours How could I possibly need to go again Oh for fuck sake I dont have time to go back home or Ill be late to work so it looks like its another thirty minute train ride totally uncomfortable But hey Im used to it now

I make it to work and head straight to the bathroom I dont even attempt to say hello to anyone They probably think Im rude Who cares I wonder if they would be up for a chat if they spent the last thirty minutes on the train focused on not shitting themselves I make it Ahhh relieffor now Thats number four since going to sleep last night Fucking chilli

I make it to my desk and get settled in for the day Check my emails plan my day and what do you know  its am and I need some breakfast Toast and a coffee I wonder how long until my next bathroom stop Its always the first thing on my mind any time I eat Imagine what that can do to a person

am rolls around and its go time I walk past my boss and hear him joke right on schedule Number five in ten hours I wonder if there will be another before lunch Surely theres nothing left I made it to lunch without another stop Is today going to take a turn for the better

pm rolls around and guess what here comes lunch Apparently I didnt get it all out at pm so I needed another round at pm Awesome number six and seven since bedtime Wow the area is very tender and I didnt bring my damn baby wipes The next stop will probably draw blood I wonder if Ill crack ten again today

I head for home and just like the morning I have a pleasant train ride spent focused on not shitting myself Oh and dont forget the back pain is still there Not so severe like the mornings It generally eases off as the day goes on But today as the back pain eased I was blessed with some joint pains in my knees because fuck it why not Yesterday it was my muscular soreness in my calvesI made it home and for some reason the urge to go again has disappeared Or maybe I told by body to fuck off and give me a break As I said before the next one would probably draw blood so maybe my body held off for me 

I got a message from one of my mates who wants to go shoot some hoops It would be great to go catch up and get some exercise but this knee pain isnt going to let me is it I have to turn him down for the third time in a row Does that make me a bad friend Does he understand what Im going through I hate talking about it I dont want to be the woe is me person But I really cant do it Im also exhausted so  minutes on the couch before cooking dinner is so damn appealing right now Just hope that urge that disappeared before doesnt come back

Mentally the  minute couch session does wonders Im ready to cook some dinner for my partner and get into some TV or what not But physically it was terrible The back pain is creeping again and the arthritic pain has spread from my knees I should have just gone to shoot hoops surely that would have hurt less Who are you kidding you know it wouldnt

Like a cog in the wheel I get dinner sorted and prepare for the next day Finally back to the couch Damn it feels good to lay down when my whole body feels like it is on fire What did I make A stir fry Hmm it shouldnt cause too many digestive issues maybe Ill go easy on the green veggies they can fuck with me sometimes I estimate two more bathroom stops before bed tonight and looking at the time now Id say the first cramp will be around pm so about two hours from now 

I settle into some nonsense on TV and there it goes AGAIN the cramps and the digestive pains A little earlier than expected but only by about twenty minutes The arthritis is pretty bad right now I sometimes wish I had a crane to help me get up I now remember how tender the area was after the last trip which means I have to go all the way upstairs to where the baby wipes are For fuck sake Each step burns Ahhhh Im so sick of this I do the deed but I know all too well thats not it for the night Surely one last hurrah before bed And yep called it That makes nine for the day",2025-01-21

Switched to Yesintek (Stelara biosimilar),"This is mostly a rant but if anyone has any advice to offer I would appreciate that too

Ive been on Stelara for  years and its worked great Additionally the copay assistance program made it super affordable for me and was relatively easy to navigate I recently got a new job and now my insurance is Kaiser Northern California so my GI and pharmacy are Kaiser as well A few days ago they sent me a message saying they are changing all Stelara prescriptions to Yesintek a newly approved biosimilar and that my prescriber approved it Im fine to try the biosimilar and I understand Kaiser wants to save costs but I was shocked how sudden it was My next dose is due tomorrow and I hardly had time to read about Yesintek and no time to talk to my GI about it who didnt mention anything when I last saw her a couple months ago

The main thing is the copay assistance program Yesintek has a copay assistance program but the site is not very good I submitted the application online but the final page which had my copay card number wasnt loading correctly and then disappeared before I could write it down I thought that would be fine I would just log in but theres no log in or patient portal on their website only the option to submit another application which doesnt seem to work since I already did it once I called the copay assistance phone number for the manufacturer Biocon Biologics and there wasnt a phone tree option for Yesintek so I hit another one When I spoke to a rep she said they didnt have a navigator group yet for Yesintek because its too new so she couldnt tell me the card info She suggested I call the medical info phone line which I did They were unhelpful but took my contact information to call back All Im looking for is the copay card  to give to the pharmacy

Kaiser did not previously take the Stelara copay assistance program like CVS pharmacy did so I had to send in my EOBs for a rebate which was frustrating but okay I was on the phone with Kaiser and the JJ copay assistance program for weeks trying to figure it all out only for Kaiser to suddenly switch to a different medication suddenly anyway Why wouldnt they give a notice ahead of time

Im supposed to take my dose tomorrow so Ill probably just pick up the new medication and pay whatever the copay is Hopefully theyll reimburse me but its worth whatever it costs to not be sick Still Im pissed and stressed that I had a medication and copay assistance program that was working fine and Kaiser suddenly changed to a medication that should work the same but who knows and that Im unable to get copay assistance for and the copay assistance program is clearly not ready Ugh thanks for reading",2025-03-06 04:13:30,500,mostly rant anyone advice offer would appreciate stelara year worked great additionally copay assistance program made super affordable relatively easy navigate recently got new job insurance kaiser northern california gi pharmacy kaiser day ago sent message saying changing stelara prescription yesintek newly approved biosimilar prescriber approved fine try biosimilar understand kaiser want save cost shocked sudden next dose due tomorrow hardly time read yesintek time talk gi mention anything last saw couple month ago main thing copay assistance program yesintek copay assistance program site good submitted application online final page copay card number loading correctly disappeared could write thought would fine would log log patient portal website option submit another application seem work since already called copay assistance phone number manufacturer biocon biologics phone tree option yesintek hit another one spoke rep said navigator group yet yesintek new tell card info suggested call medical info phone line unhelpful took contact information call back looking copay card give pharmacy kaiser previously take stelara copay assistance program like cv pharmacy send eobs rebate frustrating okay phone kaiser jj copay assistance program week trying figure kaiser suddenly switch different medication suddenly anyway give notice time supposed take dose tomorrow probably pick new medication pay whatever copay hopefully reimburse worth whatever cost sick still pissed stressed medication copay assistance program working fine kaiser suddenly changed medication work know unable get copay assistance copay assistance program clearly ready ugh thanks reading,Positivo,0.9785,Negativo

Awaiting colonoscopy. Do these symptoms seem explanable by Crohns?,"If have been going down a long path of investigations trying to understand what is causing my symptoms and Im curious if anyone had anything similar in their presentation

Started with deep diffuse right hip pain that varied in intensity day to day and was difficult to identify a trigger for I figured since I exercised daily and had a mo that maybe I was just doing a bit too much However I could confidently say I was doing nothing at that time that was any different to the previous several months As a precaution I cut out running but the hip pain got worse I just got on with things and just tolerated the flares in pain for about months before it suddenly became back pain followed by right sided pelvic pain At that stage I could not identify any pattern to my pain at all so I visited my GP who ordered blood and urine which was all normal and a ct which also didnt identify anything The purpose was to look for utibladder or kidney infectionkidney stones Nothing found Then a few days later had severe pain nausea and a really elevated heart rate that I couldnt get down so went to ED They did an external and internal ultrasound and no abnormalities found However the internal ultrasound was really provocative of my pain and so I requested a referral to my OBGYN My obgyn thought the pain was slightly too high in my right lower abdomen to be my ovary but we agreed to do a laprascope given how severe my symptoms had been and also that if he couldnt identify a cause he would remove my appendix as a possible pain source

Woke up without my appendix and nothing else abnormal to note Pain was back within hrs of the lap so I knew it hadnt been my appendix Pathology came back from appendix noting a grd  neuroendocrine tumour and some scarring of the tip of tye appendix Obgyn thought teh neuroendocrine tumour was likely a red herring as they are sometimes found incidentally during appendectomy but suggested I talk to someone else just to be thorough and follow up Due to other autonomic symptoms like POTS and tachycardia I contacted my endocrinologist to check thyroidadrenal function just in case Was all normal so he gave me referral to a gastroenterologist which led me to having a colonoscopy booked soon Throughout this whole period of the past months Ive also been seriously constipated with a BM every days on average that is very challenging to pass I often am having to take laxatives and stool softeners to achieve that In addition I have episodes of nausea but never vomiting and have lost  of my bodyweight in the past wks due to no appetite The worst of my pain is right flankback and secondary is RLQ I also have type  diabetes and have a st cousin with crohns

Seton advise? Emergency seton put in next week and I’m starting to panic.,"Please share your experience with getting a seton placed for a fistula Im beginning to panic because this is all happening very fast 

My main questions
What is intimacy like with a seton How long did you have it Do you have complex fistulas or simple Is the healing time pretty painful Have you caught the seton on clothing or had it caught on something during sex Swimming in pools or lakes Did yours constantly weep pus or did it ever stop at times Any symptoms or issues that never occurred to you couldwould happen from having a seton put in

MyF brief story 
Diagnosed with Crohns in  after my first child I was on mesalamine for almost  years It only worked enough for me to be tolerable and I was in denial of my diagnosis for years So many years wasted being naïve and not getting on biologics when it was strongly recommended I start After my second child came my second HUGE flare A few more years of neglect then it finally came down to my first abscess in late  for me to grow up and take charge of my disease The abscess returned January  Surgical drain in office and it filled back up in  weeks It has been decided by my CRS and GI that I need to get a seton placed immediately This is a rush to get me done before my first infusion of Remicade at the end of next week I am a virgin to any biologics so that is another reason why this is getting pushed so quickly Apparently the outcome is better for those who have a seton in place before starting Remicade  

This is all moving so fast and Im slowing breaking down from this This is my first surgery ever yet alone the first Crohns related surgery I will have Im beginning to freak out inside but I cant let it out because I have small children and I dont want to scare them My husband is my most supportive person and my  fan I dont know what Id do without him

Crohn's or Virus,"Hey All

I have been following this sub nervously for the past few weeks I was curious if anyone had a similar experience

A little over  weeks ago I began feeling a strange dull ache in my lower right quadrant Upon Googling this I thought I was having an appendix issues I ended up going to the ER to get checked and my appendix was fine but I had mild inflammation and wall thickening in my terminal ileum They told me I may have crohns disease

I was referred to a GI and while I waited a week for that appointment my whole family began having diarrhea I had it for a day or two my son had it for almost  days my daughter had it for almost a week and finally my wife had it for a few days Since then we have all recovered



I eventually went to the GI who ordered several stool tests another CT and a colonoscopy

The stool tests all came back normal no bacterial or parasites My blood test and stool test came back normal I had a Calprotectin score of 

Every day I have felt better and I consider myself feeling about  normal No bathroom issues mild cramping throughout stomach but no pain in lower right



Yesterday I had my second CT scan And here are my results

No gastric wall thickening Normal course and caliber of small bowel loops Terminal ileum short segment asymmetric hyperenhancement without significant wall thickening Improved right lower quadrant fat strandinginflammation No vasa recta engorgement or right lower quadrant fibrofatty proliferation No evidence of penetrating disease No inflammatory mass or abscess Normal appendix No colonic wall thickening or pericolonic inflammation No rectal wall thickening or enhancement

Terminal ileum hyperenhancement without significant wall thickening Improved right lower quadrant inflammation compared to February exam No secondary signs of Crohns disease Findings are equivocal however somewhat suspicious of inflammatory small bowel disease

After years of symptoms dating back to  I was finally diagnosed with Crohns in July  after endless testing You all know how drawn out that process is My health crashed hard earlier that year with multiple hospitalisations in a single week which led me to leave my job in April  At the time the NHS brushed it off as an infection and sent me home with antibiotics despite months of suspicious test results Frustrating doesnt even cover it

Before this Id worked at a recruitment agency for nearly  years The last two were as a recruitment consultant a role I loved It felt like my calling In  I was handed two maternity covers on top of my own role including setting up a new office from scratch I hired the entire team managed daily operations handled tech issues and still hit my recruitment targets But then my health nosedived and everything unravelled

Fast forward to now Ive been off work for a year with no warning which knackered me financially I had to move back home and PIP rejected me twice even after mandatory reconsideration Treatment finally started in December  after steroids in September ugh and Im now on Yuflyma Its helping I think Hard to tell yet but Im clinging to hope

Heres where I need help Ive decided to start my own recruitment agency Applying for roles made me realise I could do this myself Ive got a strong business plan experience and even got through to the last stages of the loan process But the final boss the lenders decision maker is rightly grilling every detail Theyre asking why Ive been unemployed and why I left my job

Do I tell them the truth Im terrified disclosing my Crohns will count against me Yes discriminations illegal but lets be real it happens Will they worry about future flare ups Or do I stay vague and risk looking secretive Im stuck between honesty and self preservation

bless my mom who has been there with me for every doctors appointment n every hospital appointment because if it wasnt for her i wouldnt of received the right treatment even the right people to speak to because the NHS seem to love fobbing off young people particularly young people who dont speaksound like they work in an office i honestly wouldnt of got anywhere the AE process would of been on repeat after repeat with getting nowhere

i went to my first GP appointment about the matter on the th of jan and explained ive had abdominalstomach pains for the past  months its currently becoming more regular that the pain occurs the pain causes me to almost crunch up into a ball im unable to move physically when the pain is occurring when i eat it will take no more than  mouth fulls until i feel the need to aggressively vomit shivers all over the body unable to breathe properly as i feel i cannot move at all otherwise more pains will erupt further

after explaining this to the doctor she said you need a rectal examination she attempted the check and as it was too painful i couldnt go through with it she then referred me to AE saying i need an urgent assessment i went to AE and waited the usual time of around  hours to see the triage nurse they took bloods and urine and waited another  hours to see a nurse who again attempted the prostate check i managed to go through with the check despite the pure pain i was in and said that they could feel a lump I awaited a further  hours for the results of the bloods they told me im anaemic and that i have vitamin D and iron deficiency which has caused my immune system to become very weak 

i was then referred to a gastro surgeon the next day i saw the surgeon they wanted to perform another prostate check to confirm the lump that had been found however i refused due to severe pain and discomfort The surgeon then put me forward for a CT scan and a colonoscopy wasnt i in for a shock i waited about a week for the CT scan then  weeks further for the colonoscopy

during my colonoscopy they took  biopsys currently still awaiting the results this whole time after the colonoscopy i was advised by a GP doctor that i should be taking ibuprofen an anti inflammatory btw which affected me in the worst way possible i asked why this was happening to the gastro surgeon and he shouted NO DO NOT TAKE ANTI INFLAMMATORYS as they will trigger your symptoms just take paracetamol from now on

i felt like for the period i was taking the ibuprofens everything had gotten dramatically worse the pains were more severe i was releasing nothing but watery sludge mixed with blood from the stalls vomiting at least  times a day Its got to a point where i have minimal energy to get out of bed to wash and my partner even has to assist Just the thought of the pain alone would make me heave This has now been on going for the past  weeks the only medication i was prescribed only up until yesterday was mebeverine which i received on the st feb Ive been taking  a day alongside  paracetamols a day but yet im still in so much pain

so yesterday th of march i finally had my gastroenterology appointment which i had been waiting for since my colonoscopy This appointment put me more at ease due to speaking to a gastro specialist and she confirmed the diagnosis as crohns disease AKA IBD or crazy bowel She instructed to now stick to a low residue controlled dieton top of that i then received my first prescription with these numerous medications i was required to take for the official condition I have been given  weeks worth of medication which Im pretty sure is just the beginning 

Lansoprazole mg
Prednisolone mg 
AdcalD chewables 
Mebeverine mg 
Nutricia fortisip ml  bottles 
and taking my daily  paracetamols 

from today i am starting this medication i hope the new turn in my journey has good things in store for me even though it will probably be for the rest of my life but at least ill hopefully be relieved of this pain i never thought that id ever go through such an experience but we can only hope for better and pray to God",2025-03-05 10:14:39,902,uk whole experience find cause excruciating stomach pain journey around year ago started noticing abnormal stomach pain particularly rare get pain probably say time every fortnight naive ignored stomach pain seek medical attention concerned time past month got progressively worse point complaining pain family partner told need go doctor bring issue light could see going normal bless mom every doctor appointment n every hospital appointment received right treatment even right people speak seem love fobbing young people particularly young people speaksound like work office honestly got anywhere ae process would repeat repeat getting nowhere went first gp appointment matter th jan explained abdominalstomach pain past month currently becoming regular pain occurs pain cause almost crunch ball unable move physically pain occurring eat take mouth full feel need aggressively vomit shiver body unable breathe properly feel cannot move otherwise pain erupt explaining doctor said need rectal examination attempted check painful go referred ae saying need urgent assessment went ae waited usual time around hour see triage nurse took blood urine waited another hour see nurse attempted prostate check managed go check despite pure pain said could feel lump awaited hour result blood told anaemic vitamin iron deficiency caused immune system become weak referred gastro surgeon next day saw surgeon wanted perform another prostate check confirm lump found however refused due severe pain discomfort surgeon put forward ct scan colonoscopy shock waited week ct scan week colonoscopy colonoscopy took biopsy currently still awaiting result whole time colonoscopy advised gp doctor taking ibuprofen anti inflammatory btw affected worst way possible asked happening gastro surgeon shouted take anti inflammatorys trigger symptom take paracetamol felt like period taking ibuprofen everything gotten dramatically worse pain severe releasing nothing watery sludge mixed blood stall vomiting least time day got point minimal energy get bed wash partner even assist thought pain alone would make heave going past week medication prescribed yesterday mebeverine received st feb taking day alongside paracetamols day yet still much pain yesterday th march finally gastroenterology appointment waiting since colonoscopy appointment put ease due speaking gastro specialist confirmed diagnosis crohn disease aka ibd bowel instructed low residue controlled dieton top received first prescription numerous medication required take official condition given week worth medication pretty sure beginning lansoprazole mg prednisolone mg adcald chewables mebeverine mg nutricia fortisip ml bottle taking daily paracetamols today starting medication hope new turn journey good thing store even though probably rest life least hopefully relieved pain never thought ever go experience hope better pray god,Negativo,-0.9579,Neutro

Contemplating the the effectiveness of my medication.,"Alright so the title is misleading I know Remicade works wonders for myself as well as MANY other people 

I am currently  and a half years old and was diagnosed with Crohns at the age of three shortly after my parents adopted me from Russia  After a few trial and errors Dr Whittington of Lebonheur in Memphis put me on Remicade I was one of the youngest patients approved for Remicade at that time 

Fast forward  years later Ive grown my entire life going to infusions every  weeks getting colonoscopies etc Nothing major compared to others My Crohns is mainly in my lower intestines Ive kept it under remission since then with a bad flare up once a year or so 

I was always consistent going to appointments as a kid since my mom would always take care of that stuff but Ive slacked off after growing up and gaining independence I always hear how Im at big risk for lymphoma and other cancers due to the medication on top of other risks so it makes me uneasy Its been stated that once you get off Remicade theres a big chance you cant just come back to it 

Are natural remedies okay instead of using medication I know it sounds goofy but its legitimate I got every two months to an infusion My last one was scheduled for November   Today is March   Ive learned how to really maintain stress levels this would trigger flare ups like crazy I smoke a lot of weed I have a career and dont let getting a stoner get in the way lol changed up my diet since then and maintain an active lifestyle Since cutting out bread and junky greasy sugary foods my stomach hasnt had many issues Stools are always loose but I can work with that Any stomach aches I have can be suppressed by cannabis mainly at night

Almost had an overdose due to a doctors bad advice!,"Hello everyone 

Time for a bit of a rant unfortunately but also a post to raise awareness 

Ive unfortunately started to relapse again and I didnt want to leave it too long before being seen by a doctor again as the last time it did that it sent me into the worst flare up ever 

Anyway called the NHS  non emergency line for advice and they gave me an out of hours appointment that night 

On arrival I could instantly sense the doctor didnt care and just wanted to get through all of his patients that night After he asked me all the questions and felt my abdomen he said he could either up my dose of Mercaptopurine for ONLY  DAYS pointless right or send me to the emergency department to actually get tested fully 

Something in my head told me to not up my dose of medication as I know its based on weight and it takes weeks to actually kick in 

Luckily I said no and went to the ED And after speaking to an IBD nurse today she said thank goodness you didnt up your dose because then youd have been overdosing and would be causing severe liver damage and could possible cause liver failure 

Well you could imagine the look on my face and my reaction I was furious I understand that not all doctors are full gastroenterologists but not properly understanding a medication and then telling a patient to take a dose which couldve been lethal is a bit severe in my opinion 

So what Im trying to say is if any other doctor is giving advice about treatment and medications and theyre not your assigned consultant please be careful and dont be afraid to question their advice or refuse treatment as this could be very severe to you down the line like it almost was to me",2025-03-04 21:07:07,315,hello everyone time bit rant unfortunately also post raise awareness unfortunately started relapse want long seen doctor last time sent worst flare ever anyway called non emergency line advice gave hour appointment night arrival could instantly sense doctor care wanted get patient night asked question felt abdomen said could either dose mercaptopurine day pointless right send emergency department actually get tested fully something head told dose medication know based weight take week actually kick luckily said went ed speaking ibd nurse today said thank goodness dose overdosing would causing severe liver damage could possible cause liver failure could imagine face reaction furious understand doctor full gastroenterologist properly understanding medication telling patient take dose couldve lethal bit severe opinion trying say doctor giving advice treatment medication assigned consultant please careful afraid question advice refuse treatment could severe line like almost,Negativo,-0.9809,Negativo

Severe worsening weaknessThis is my biggest issue right now It comes on suddenly even when Ive eaten recently and its getting more frequent and lasting longer When it happens I can barely speak and if I try to fight through it my whole body eventually goes limp Its to the point where I cant complete basic daily tasks like cleaning or taking my dog for a walk Today my legs nearly buckled underneath me at work

Extreme nausea with the weaknessThe two always go hand in hand and its becoming unbearable

Strained intestinal feeling  passing mucus againFeels like my intestines are struggling and Ive been passing mucus along with pelletlike stools

Severe constipation and bloatingI constantly feel backed up and doctors just tell me to take laxatives indefinitely

Fluid retentionMy hands swell and I feel puffy all over

Pins and needlesfoot crampsHappens more often now especially when walking upstairs

Flulike symptoms  frequent illnessI was bedridden last month and now I have a phlegmy cough again I constantly feel run down

Difficulty swallowingIt feels like food gets stuck in my throat and this only started since taking the injection


My doctors are refusing to consider that Yuflyma might be the problem They just push laxatives and tell me my labs are fine But I dont feel fineI feel worse than ever This weakness and nausea are taking over my life forcing me to cancel plans and struggle with even small tasks

A life in the margins of normalcy,"Theres a unique alienation that comes with chronic illnessespecially one as insidious as Crohns disease It is not a condition that elicits immediate sympathy like cancer nor does it come with a visible marker of suffering It exists in the shadows of perception a silent war within ones own body that few truly understand

Crohns is at its core a betrayal The body which should be the vessel for our ambitions our desires our simple pleasures instead becomes an unpredictable antagonist Plans are made with an asterisk Spontaneity is a luxury The simple joy of eating is tinged with risk and the bathroom is less a necessity and more a second home

But the most insidious aspect isnt the physical painits the erosion of ones sense of normalcy The world moves at a pace I cant always match Social interactions are punctuated by silent calculations How far is the nearest restroom Will this food trigger a flare Will my body betray me today

Theres also a strange duality in perception to others I am either too sick a burden unreliable dramatic or not sick enough because I dont look the part There is no perfect equilibrium of being ill in a way that is both understood and accommodated

Crohns taints human experience by forcing an ongoing negotiation with suffering It transforms the simplest aspects of existencefood movement intimacyinto potential minefields It fosters a quiet creeping bitterness not necessarily toward life itself but toward the illusion that most people get to live unencumbered

And yet there is a strange resilience that emerges from such suffering A kind of grim camaraderie with others who understand the weight of an unreliable body A deep appreciation for the rare fleeting moments when everything feels okay

Living with Crohns is living with limitation but also with an awareness of what it means to endure It is a life both tainted and sharpened by pain A life spent on the margins of normalcyalways watching always wishing but still somehow still here",2025-03-04 02:27:03,335,unique alienation come chronic illnessespecially one insidious crohn disease condition elicits immediate sympathy like cancer come visible marker suffering exists shadow perception silent war within one body truly understand crohn core betrayal body vessel ambition desire simple pleasure instead becomes unpredictable antagonist plan made asterisk spontaneity luxury simple joy eating tinged risk bathroom less necessity second home insidious aspect physical painits erosion one sense normalcy world move pace cant always match social interaction punctuated silent calculation far nearest restroom food trigger flare body betray today also strange duality perception others either sick burden unreliable dramatic sick enough part perfect equilibrium way understood accommodated crohn taint human experience forcing ongoing negotiation suffering transforms simplest aspect existencefood movement intimacyinto potential minefield foster quiet creeping bitterness necessarily toward life toward illusion people get live unencumbered yet strange resilience emerges suffering kind grim camaraderie others understand weight unreliable body deep appreciation rare fleeting moment everything feel okay living crohn living limitation also awareness mean endure life tainted sharpened pain life spent margin normalcyalways watching always wishing still somehow still,Negativo,-0.9929,Negativo

Anyone have pain in calves and tingling in feet and hands.,"Hi everyone I just wanted to ask a quick question for the last few weeks I have bad pain in my calves Mainly just the left It started intermittently and mainly at night along with pins and needles sensation in my feet Its pretty much constant now along with some tingling in my wrists and hands 
Could this be related to Crohns I was first diagnosed last May at  I was initially started on stelara as I have previously had cancer However I was changed to inflectra infliximab as the stellara wasnt working My calprotectin stayed above  
I guess Im a little more concerned than normal as my mother has MS and I went down the rabbit hole of google and found a link 
I will be speaking to my GI nurse tomorrow hopefullyto get the latest calprotectin results and see if this is one for the GP 
Just looking for some info before I speak to them 
Thanks guys

"In honor of our 3 months since diagnosis, and finally being discharged from children’s hospital this week, I wanted to share my daughter’s story. 💜","Originally posted on rmommit Feel free to ignore its super long I just wanted to share her story and all she has overcome

 months ago today started out like any other day My  year old daughter woke up acting pretty tired but I figured it was just because we had kept her up late the night before watching Moana  I thought it was a little weird when she came out to the kitchen visibly shivering despite wearing  layers of jammies and insisted on keeping her blanket on her at all times She didnt want any breakfast and started complaining of her tummy hurting I checked her temp but she didnt have a fever Just figured she was catching a winter bug so I set her up on the couch and let her watch some Bluey She was excited because she almost never gets screen time in the mornings I left her with my husband while I went to shower and get dressed A few minutes later I heard my husband scream Couldnt really make out what he was saying but I jumped out and ran to them This image will be forever etched in my mind She was lying on the couch like a limp rag doll struggling to breathe and gasping for air Her skin was turning a light shade of blue My husband was shaking her and yelling her name and she could barely open her eyes All I remember myself doing is screaming but I managed to take out my phone and call  An ambulance arrived within minutes and rushed us to the nearest ER Keep in mind we live in a small coastal town in New England so this ER while wonderful was definitely not equipped to treat her They immediately started her on high flow oxygen and IV fluid resuscitation however her stats just kept dropping to the point where they told us she was now in acute respiratory failure and we were going to be airlifted to the nearest childrens hospital where they could put her on a ventilator Around this time her labs came back and they were extremely concerning they showed hypovolemic shock she had a hemoglobin of three and secondary kidney failure So they started a blood transfusion and off we went to Boston Childrens Hospital in a MediVac She briefly gained consciousness while we were in the air and asked why we were in an airplane were we going on vacation Which made me break down The next several hours are a blur to me We got to Boston and were immediately triaged into a room in the PICU where she was sedated and put on a ventilator Between all of the blood transfusions fluids antibiotics and organ failure medications they put her on she had  IVs in her little arms Watching your child be kept alive by tubes and machines is an unimaginably awful feeling They let us stay with her the entire time they were reviving her which I later learned was only because they didnt think she was going to make it Even after she was initially stabilized her little body was just so fragile that they kept warning us she might not make it through the night At one point the PICU doctor brought by a chaplain to discuss our wishes for end of life which was the worst moment of my life and I am so thankful we didnt get to that point A previously completely healthy  year old doesnt just develop hypovolemic shock and multisystem organ failure out of the blue we were all so mystified and blindsided I will fast forward this story because I dont want to make it too long but the immediate suspicion was a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm They did an abdominal CT which cleared her of that but also showed severely inflamed intestines Her pediatric GI came around and told us that hypovolemic shock couldve been caused by GI issues especially considering how far behind she is in both height and weight So they arranged for an endoscopycolonoscopy when she was stable enough to do so On Thursday a couple days after she was initially admitted they did both upper and lower scopes and diagnosed her with Crohns Disease She was immediately started on IV steroids and Remicade I was honestly shocked beyond belief My mom has UC but she has never been hospitalized for it and is controlled by just oral medications so I always assumed it was a mild disease I never imagined that IBD could cause anything this severe Over the next few days they tried to extubate her several times however her body never cooperated and she always ended up back on the ventilator Finally after  nights intubated she got to come off of the ventilator She is such a warrior A couple days later we moved to PICU step down and transitioned her to all oral medications And then on Christmas Eve after  days admitted we got to take her home Best Christmas present ever We still have a LONG road ahead of us and she is currently on  medications including monthly Remicade We also have to follow up with the organ transplant teams to determine the extent of organ damage she has from being in hypovolemic shock which is absolutely terrifying We already know her lungs liver and kidneys were all affected but we are hoping it is just mild damage that can be controlled by medication and monitoring In addition to coping with an incurable diagnosis on a  year old Its a lot and some days I just want to crawl up in a ball and cry about how much our life has changed since December rd I am so grateful that she survived but at the same time all I feel is deep sadness and anger that this had to happen to my baby Our lives are forever changed and its not fair Anyway if you made it this far THANK YOU

Recently Diagnosed: Calprotectin score slightly above 5000 but I feel fine!?,"Hey everyone So Im very new to dealing with disease Recently diagnosed M Currently have pan colitis but my doctors are pretty sure it Crohns due to recital sparing Any way Ive had lots of testing done recently and my blood work was all fairly normal My Vitamin D is low but Creactive protein was fairly normal

I have chronic constipation due to a tortuous colon which is why when I started having daily loose stools I was like Im going normal No somethings up along with cramping of course but recently Ive been even back to my own normal Some urgency when I do have to go but its usually own once or twice a week sometimes daily

"Surgery two times, ambulance, flue, wound infection, nausea, watery poop. All within three weeks. I’m exhausted.","Ive had my Crohns disease for  years now and had my first surgery the th of feb Im  years old from Sweden 

They cut cm of my small intestine took away my blind intestine and  cm of my thick intestine and connected the small and the thick column back together 

I was at the hospital for  days Im traumatized

I was struggling with low blood pressure and severe pain post op which made it impossible for me to mobilize and I even fainted while trying to stand up

Day two I had severe pain in my stomach and my column hadnt started functioning again and I got a fever and felt really bad

They took a Covid test it came back negative They took blood infection and inflammation tests nothing out of the normal

My doctor suspected complications where the column were connected together and sent me nearly straight away to have another surgery during midnight My doctor started drawing on my stomach saying where they would put a stomia since it was a high risk of getting one if there was complications 

My heart sank to the ground since that has been my worst nightmare with this disease

When I woke up I realized I didnt have a stomia and the doctor said that everything looked okay however my intestine was inactive which was something we had to focus on to make sure I could walk and make sure my intestine started working again 

I got a different program to control my pain levels I hadnt slept for nearly three days at that time which was pure torture 

However I managed to walk so they took away my catheter I was certain that I would get an urine infection the antibiotics probably helped me from that but gave me fungal infection instead

Day   and  was just me trying to mobilize and trying to get my strength to walk again and get rid of the nausea caused of inactive gut 

I will never take walking for granted ever again 

Anyways Day  I could go home or to my stepparents since my fiancé and kid had the flue

Day  I decided to come home since my stepparents also got sick

Day  I woke up with a bad fever Severe pain and felt totally lost 

The ambulance had to drive me  kilometers to nearest hospital

I had gotten the flue

They sent me home after all the checkups However it was pm and no way for me to go home since there are no cabs or busses to where I live that hour so I had to take a cab from the hospital go check in at a hotel with burning fever nearly fainting feeling like shit

I had never felt so alone and exhausted in my whole life

Day  I felt better from the flue no fever at least Still coughing and tired

Day  I realized one of my wounds were quite watery I opened up the bandage only to realize I had a whole in my stomach where they went in operation nr It was definitely infected Its gonna leave a nice scar

Today day  Im eating antibiotics again and Ive never ever felt this disgusted by my own body Im exhausted depressed and just off balance Im shitting nearly  times a day only water and everything feels useless 

Can I please just be healthy

Has anyone else gone through this shit I really had to write this to you guys No one else can imagine the shit we go through 

Thanks guys 

Appreciate it

Rinvoq 45mg advice,"I recently changed from Infliximab to rinvoq as Infliximab was causing me to have too many problems like fevers and i was also in a really bad flare as i was practically on no medication etc I then got took into hospital and they put me on steriods in the meantime to reduce inflammation and find a plan for which medication i should go on for my crohns They gave me two option skyrizi or rinvoq i chose rinvoq as it had better reviews and was also a tablet form not an injection which I would find easier as no need to come to hospital every week and sit for hours getting an infusion However it was going so well taking the tablet every day until about three weeks in i woke up with my face in agony and broke out in spots and cysts under the skin My face was so sore I went to the GP and he insisted i go to AE So I went After waiting hours they then admitted into a ward and said i have a skin infection of acne I then said this is not acne as my face was fine before and ive all of a sudden woken up like this and its also in my gums and my scalp I then started to think it was chicken pox which was hoping it really wasnt as being on a biological drug and having chickenpox can be dangerous The doctors were demanding that it wasnt chicken pox and kept telling me to wait on dermatology to see me I said okay but can we do a chicken pox test in case anyway so they did They then came in the following day saying the dermatologist cannot see me so they took pictures of my face and body as it was now starting to spread to my chest back and legs To me it started to sound more and more like chicken pox so i was becoming frustrated with the doctors telling me it isnt and that it is just acne Ive never had chicken pox before that is why I was so worried Anyways now the dermatology has gotten back to me and said it is infection of acne and put me on antibiotics called flucloxcillin they said they are certain it will clear away with this However now im starting to feel reluctant to go back onto rinvoq as im scared it is giving me the spots my Gastro doctor says its prednisone giving me this reaction however ive been on steriods in the past and this has never happened They also want to start me on roaccutane to take along with the rinvoq as this will take away the spots but im just really reluctant to do that to my body as i think rinvoq is causing harm What do u think i should do Go back on rinvoq and just forget everything basically is what they are saying and that ive not to judge it on the crohns med it could be the steroids and because im on a tapering dose of the prednisone the spots may go away Im just really certain it is not the steroids making this happen to me

Calprotectin & symptoms but clear colonoscopy and MRI,"Hi all

crohn's disease and how it affects mental health and it's connection to the gut-brain axis,"Ive struggled with Crohns disease since I was a child and only recently have I discovered just how much it has affected my mental health I recently experienced a severe flareup which was also accompanied by C diff Clostridium difficile a type of bacteria that causes intestinal infections C diff commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics which disrupt the normal balance of gut bacteria and allow this infection to overgrow This put me in the hospital

Ive consistently experienced flulike symptoms due to my weakened immune system so Im often on antibiotics further disrupting the balance in my gut Currently Im weaning off prednisolone which is the first time Ive been prescribed steroids for my Crohns as my gut has never been this inflamed I was also given vancomycin to treat the C diff infection What I noticed while taking vancomycin and prednisolone was that I was going to the bathroom normally which was nothing short of amazing I felt truly normal  I had no anxiety wasnt overthinking and didnt feel paranoid or depressed It was like I became a completely different person with a completely new outlook on life

However as my gut has flared up again all of those mental health issues have returned It made me realize that  of serotonin is actually stored in the gut I never understood how truly deep the connection between my gut health and my mental wellbeing was until this experience All these years I thought something was inherently wrong with me but it turns out its been my Crohns all along

Not sure who needs to hear this…..💜 (kinda long sorry),"Hey everyone  F here  in  weeks  Something came over me that inspired me to create this post I cant pinpoint exactly However I did want to say to anyone that is struggling with Crohns right now physically mentally emotionally it gets better It really does  

Long story short I was diagnosed with Crohns in  during Covid at  years old and I thought my life was over I got into bed that night and couldnt stop sobbing all night until I eventually tired out at am Pretty soon after that night I began on Remicade and Im still on it almost  years later and doing well

When it was safe to return to college after the pandemic I did for a little while but then I needed to return home from my apartment and be taken out of school for a full year because I was really struggling with my Crohns again I was supposed to graduate undergrad in  but I did in May of 

There was a very long time where all I saw in myself was Crohns From getting my infusions to other appointments and managing my diet I saw myself as Crohns only and not my other qualitiesthings I enjoy doing It may take some time but once you find the best ways for you to manage Crohns things get SO much better While I graduated undergrad later than I had planned it wasnt the end of the world after all I graduated with my Bachelor of Exercise Science and a Minor of Nutritional Science 

In January this year I moved to a new state to begin my Master of OT occupational therapy at my top choice university and Ive been loving it Ive always been pretty social and I have lots of friends who know I have Crohns but they accept me for who I am they are there to listen and they see more in me than my chronic illness I had a few friends that left me when I told them I have Crohns but youll find who your real people are 

Do I still feel sad sometimes about having to manage Crohns and missing the way certain things were before all of this For sure I acknowledge these feelings cry throw ice cubes outside when I am angry etc but I know that what Im dealing with makes me even stronger Crohns aside I am a good friend social and I love to cookbake I love photography and seeking out new places to take photos and I love music traveling being active and spending time with my cat I am just  minutes from the beach so I love going there to clear my mind

Crohns diagnosis trouble,"HI All 

I am having trouble getting a Crohns diagnosis and wanted some thoughts 

Im a yr old white male I have had stomach trouble all my life some of my earliest memories are spending long times in the bathroom with cramps and aches I remember one Thanksgiving when I was about  years old I didnt get to spend any of it with my family because I was in the bathroom the entire day Needless to say this has been a lifelong struggle 

I saw a GI specialist when I was about  and because I am and was then really overweight the doctor dismissed all my concerns as Lose weight This was a depressing episode of no answers 

About  years ago I had such a bad flare I was having upwards of  bowel movements a day I spent one day at work in the bathroom only coming out to deal with a patient work in healthcare for  mins and then right back to the bathroom I went to my PCP and he ordered a CT scan The scan showed inflammation in my terminal ileum My PCP referred me to a GI specialist and after he reviewed the CT scan said If it smells like Crohns and walks like Crohns its Crohns I was so bad at the time I was on an almost all liquid diet for nearly two weeks After two weeks of the nearly liquid diet I had a colonoscopy and the results were that I had some inflammation in the TI but the GI doctor put it off to NSAID induced colitis He recommended I stop taking any Nsaids and I did 

Needless to say I was depressed that I still didnt have a diagnosis and that it felt like yet another doctor had dismissed my concerns 

Fast forward to almost two weeks ago and while starting a drive to Texas I started having some bad symptoms On  I went to the restroom  times and was having bad cramps and  stool on the Bristol chart I was having terrible pain in my stomach and lower abdomen A long week and lbs down later and I got an appointment with a GI doctor I reviewed my symptoms with him and relayed my thoughts that the clinical picture fit Crohns for me 

The Gi specialist was not as concerned since my blood did not show anemia and im still well fat My symptoms are improving and I feel as though I am going through the same process again I have a CT enterography scheduled for tomorrow and then I will scheduled my colonoscopy and EGD I feel like I will not show the symptoms I am was and that they will not see the symptoms I know I am having The GI doctor is pushing that this is just IBS I feel like I am going crazy I feel unheard I feel depressed 

Has anyone else gone through this Does being fat rule out Crohns Am I crazy

Canadians - Olestyr is available again!!,"Since my partner stopped being able to get his Olestyr around this time last year weve been checking every once in a while to see if the shortage has resolved or not or if we can find any updated information at all about it Most of the time we either find nothing or that the expected resolution date getting pushed out even further again 

Well and few nights ago we get a message from his mom asking if he had his medication again because they saw the shortage was resolved and we had no idea I almost cried honestly

Is this disease as invisible and hard to diagnose as it seems?,"And how long how hard did you have to fight to get a diagnosis much less relief

Listen I dont know if I have Crohns Im not a doctor but I have been searching for an answer for  years and Im tired For context I am a  year old woman in America Im gonna give you guys a couple things about what Ive been going through and please tell me if Im crazy or what because doctors dont seem to care whats wrong with me and Im wasting away literally and emotionally and getting nothing on any medical test Please bear with the rant I seriously dont know what to do and I feel like my body is killing me and Ill be dead before I find answers but Crohns seems to be the only thing that pops up with all these things in common

For starters food and I have always had a complex relationship Eating has genuinely made me some degree of uncomfortable or nauseous for as long as I can remember This has graduated to intense pressure and pain as of late Even when I havent eaten and im starving food hits like lead I have spent more time than not painfully bloated for days at a time or with unwavering cramps all over my abdomen Especially on the right side and lower back areas My abdomen has also been visibly heavier on the right side for as long as I can remember 

Ive been diagnosed with endometriosis since I was about  I never got a laparoscopy to confirm because my primary didnt think it was necessary if we could avoid cutting me open for no reason The reason for this diagnosis is I would have excruciating cramps that would make it hard to stand up that would go on for  days atleast every time I had that time of the month from like  onward That being said to my surprise I was able to have two healthy children without trying a blessing Ill admit because that is not many peoples experience with endo 

After my daughter was born almost  years ago I had pelvic pain that never went away I went to  months of pelvic floor therapy and a completely healthy internal ultrasound No answers and absolutely no improvement The gi problems stayed about the same Lots of bloating lots of painful pressure or lack of room lots of generalized pain Then my son was born  years after her And then I had omnipresent flank pain on my right side Dull usually sometimes white hot searing pain with nothing that could relieve it After white knuckling that for about a year I get an abdominal ultrasound when it is especially unbearable I had SEVERE hydronephrosis fluid back up in swollen kidney like fit me in for an emergency full contrast ct less than  days later at a urologist By the time I did get into the ct again less than a week later the pain vanished and my CT CAME BACK NORMAL My primary was floored it could just VANISH like that But another normal test so I ignored it 

Until about  months ago I have always been anemic I have always had horrible joints but lately if I sleep funny I wake up with my knees on FIRE for atleast the first half of the day I have always been extremely run down after a full nights rest I have always gotten frequent migraines But six months ago I started losing atleast a pound a week And couldnt do anything to stop the weight loss much less gain it back Ive added protein shakes It didnt even slow down I started at  Im  pounds now 

I went to the er two weeks ago because I had the respiratory flu for a few days and on like day three i had worse flank pain than the episode that made me get the ultrasound years ago I had horrible cramping all over my abdomen And I felt like I had a spear through my lower right abdomen That stung like a bitch every time I moved They did ANOTHER ct normal They did a chest xray I guess that looks at your bowels somehow NORMAL The ers best explanation was constipation even though Id consider myself pretty regular 

So while I wait for a gi I start miralax and colace No change Not in pain or my bowel movements I drank a saline laxative NOTHING HAPPENED I see the gi for a colonoscopy and endoscopy Normal Biopsies taken Benign But the prep I literally did more prep than they told me and it didnt clear me out They graded me as fair I literally prepped for three days and I followed everything to the letter and they only asked me to prep for two I have been tested for every disorder or thyroid problem or whatever your blood can be tested for NORMAL

SIR Youre the doctor here not me I guess around there theyre mostly used to seeing basic injuries like a fishing hook in the foot or something like that I didnt even know what to say I asked them to do bloodwork and said I maybe needed a short course of steroids 

The nurse comes in to do my blood work He looks at my arm says oh sick I never got to take blood through a tattoo before and proceeded to poke me about  times before I told him to go get someone else because he simply could not do it

Where do they find these nurses and doctors because how did you go through medical school and just have no clue what Crohns even is or how to take blood properly

Cigna Medical confirmed that the infusion is covered since its medically necessary but I will be responsible for my deductible   of the cost and then that would apply to my OOP max They cant confirm on the maintence SubQ and refer me to Express Scripts and subsuently Accredo

Infusion rooms are so awkward,"please dont be mean  this is just my opinion as an introvert lol  

I find it so awkward how the infusion clinic has  privacy

  people sat extremely close and facing each other  veryyyyy tiny room  

 being asked personal medical questions out in the open  
uncomfortable asking questions I dont like disclosing medications or health conditions to strangers  who are all there for different reasons

 being instructed to self inject in a room of people feels very very weird  room full of old men too 

  Also in my experience Im the youngest and gayest and only female in the room lol  


No one wears masks either  including the nurses   despite us all sitting extremely close and being immunocompromised The website says masks are mandatory but Im the only one who wears one

 ironic bc i asked a nurse how i can prevent getting sick and she said make sure i wear a mask in public

Dealing with the hospital is a pain in the ass,"Sorry excuse the pun Ive been having a flare up for like  years now and Ive not responded to the meds that I was put on back in September so now I have to deal with an incompetent IBD team again so I just need to rant about them 

They tell me that they cant do anything without different tests fair enough but once I have them done or send things in I have to chase them up for weeks to get an answer only for them to say that they were just about to call before they got my message and they saw my results weeks ago 
They cancelled my endoscopy last year because they didnt think it was worth the wait Ive been passing copious amounts of blood and having accidents that are nothing but blood so they finally decided to do a scope over a year later but only on my sigmoid colon despite me reporting and telling them I have pain everywhere and the scope was bad enough that the people who were in the room with me straight up said thats bad without prompting when they looked at the screen and then told me that the images made them flinch and they could imagine that it was causing me a lot of pain and it was nowhere near remission 

I tell them about my pain and they disregard what I tell them I tell them that my pain is centralised on my right side and they completely ignore me and just talk about my left side because thats where Crohns is Ive told them that Im leaking constantly and they ignore it Ive told them over  times that Ive been having back pain where my liver is for over a year which started with my flare up and gets worse when I open my bowelspass copious amounts of blood and mucus and theyve ignored it every time  
Ive told them that despite my high pain threshold Im being sick because of the pain that Im experiencing and its genuinely making me wish I was dead and they tell me they cant prescribe me pain relief because they and I quote know that the pain is from Crohns so theres no point in giving anything for it and then told me to drink peppermint tea for pain that makes me vomit and cry 
Just a few hours ago I woke up with blinding pain that had me scrambling to the bathroom on the verge of tears and this pain wakes me up all of the time which Ive informed them about numerous times in the past year I can be in so much pain that I dont move from my bed for days at a time because all I can do is lie face down and hold my guts 

I was left for  months without meds when it shouldve been an  week wait and they only did something because they were being threatened with being reported to PALS 
I only got to see my GI last year because of the threat to report the IBD team to PALS and they just sat across from me and told me that I probably need to be prescribed pain relief to help me only to proceed to not do that 
They make me appointments to see my GI who I dont get to see as it is which I get because they have other patients and then they cancel the appointments and dont tell me or send me letters to inform me at all so I struggle to get myself ready and in a position to leave my house just to be told by the front desk that they cancelled it weeks ago 

Honestly Im just tired of feeling this way for so long Im frustrated to the point of tears a lot having to deal with them Im telling them the same things over and over and over again and it feels like theyre either not listening or trying to catch me in lies If I wanted drugs Id probably choose something a little more fun than codeine and if I wanted attention Id probably choose something less humiliating than crapping my pants a full grown woman 
I feel as if Im asking to be treated like royalty just by simply telling them about my symptoms I get the NHS is strained and nurses and doctors are under a lot of pressure but surely it shouldnt be this difficult to be taken seriously as someone whos chronically ill I understand that you have to advocate for yourself but its just so ridiculous and negligent to only take your sick patients seriously when they use up the little energy they have to fight you like how does that make sense But tbf Im dealing with people that seem to think that peppermint tea will combat pain thats bad enough to make me puke so theyre obviously lacking a lot of it",2025-03-01 00:42:32,836,sorry excuse pun flare like year responded med put back september deal incompetent ibd team need rant tell cant anything without different test fair enough done send thing chase week get answer say call got message saw result week ago cancelled endoscopy last year think worth wait passing copious amount blood accident nothing blood finally decided scope year later sigmoid colon despite reporting telling pain everywhere scope bad enough people room straight said thats bad without prompting looked screen told image made flinch could imagine causing lot pain nowhere near remission tell pain disregard tell tell pain centralised right side completely ignore talk left side thats crohn told leaking constantly ignore told time back pain liver year started flare get worse open bowelspass copious amount blood mucus ignored every time told despite high pain threshold sick pain experiencing genuinely making wish dead tell cant prescribe pain relief quote know pain crohn point giving anything told drink peppermint tea pain make vomit cry hour ago woke blinding pain scrambling bathroom verge tear pain wake time informed numerous time past year much pain move bed day time lie face hold gut left month without med week wait something threatened reported pal got see gi last year threat report ibd team pal across told probably need prescribed pain relief help proceed make appointment see gi get see get patient cancel appointment tell send letter inform struggle get ready position house told front desk cancelled week ago honestly tired feeling way long frustrated point tear lot deal telling thing feel like either listening trying catch lie wanted drug probably choose something little fun codeine wanted attention probably choose something less humiliating crapping full grown woman feel asking treated like royalty simply telling symptom get strained nurse doctor lot pressure surely difficult taken seriously someone chronically understand advocate ridiculous negligent take sick patient seriously use little energy fight like make sense tbf dealing people seem think peppermint tea combat pain thats bad enough make puke obviously lacking lot,Negativo,-0.9994,Negativo

"Stelara, side effects and changing drugs","Hi 

My doctors are trying to move me to Stelara from my current drug Infliximab 

Ive been on infliximab since I was  and I am currently  Its been great but I have horrific psoriasis which I have gone to the dermatologist for I was told to take Sotokyu which then gave me acne Then I was told to take accutane and so on  it was a mess And to be honest with you although I live in Australia and I am so grateful for our healthcare I can not afford to go to the dermatologist or pay for any new medications since I am incharge of my personal health bills 

For previous history I developed Rheumatoid arthritis on Salazopyrine when I was  which is why I am nervous about starting stelara I have heard that joint pain is a side affect and I can not go through that again  it was traumatic I also run nearly every day and I dance a lot too Being active is my way of staying happy and ultimately controlling my disease 

My mum also passed away from melanoma I have heard there is increased risk of melanoma on this medication Since her cancer was brought on by a specific gene I am a bit nervous 

My doctors feel that this drug is the safest alternative to Infliximab 

The change has been brought on by a recent mini flair most likely being brought on by travelling

Bouts of diarrhea up to  times per day during flares with a lot of blood and mucous in stool During periods of remission I get constipated Severe abdominal bloating and distention like looking like I e just entered my third trimester of pregnancy type bloating with feelings of extreme fullness especially after eating Swelling in face and hands as well as joint pain specifically hands elbows knees and back and sometimes neck No specific foods seem to cause the pain it just seems to come on at random times Yes I have hemorrhoids Ive pushed three kids out And yes sometimes they flare up its difficult to keep them at bay when youre on the toilet  times per day and when youre not youre constipated But I know the feeling of hemorrhoids as I have had them for  years I can feel the difference between my hemorrhoids acting up and the other things happening and they are not the same It also started out being a little pain and swelling and stuff and then over the years the flares have gotten to be more and more frequent intense and painful Now I just feel like Im in a never ending flare I have less days of feeling normal per month than not sex is always painful because Im always swollen in there during sex I literally feel like its stabbing my intestines and bladder And speaking of bladder I feel a lot more kidney pain and feel what I believe are passing kidney stones which is also happening more frequently now  I get nausea a lot headaches all the time feel dehydrated despite drinking a ton of water feel exhausted despite getting plenty of sleep and I also have noticed a lot of my poop looks like undigested food Like I can clearly see what I ate just by looking at my poop Its gotten to the point now where I am in near constant pain I try to push through it and just continue with my life because I have a lot of stuff going on but it affects me in every single way My frequency and type of bowel movements has me embarrassed to go to the bathroom at work so I have to drive home a lot during working hours and just come up with excuses for why I need to leave Or it has me holding it in out of fear of embarrassment which causes even more pain I find it difficult to concentrate at work because Im hurting and my stomach always makes the loudest noises at all times Because of these things I even have found this to affect my ability to even try to make friends or leave the house I cant travel long trips out of fear of having diarrhea or getting severely constipated There have even been occurrences of accidentally having diarrhea in my underwear or feeling leaking which is just another layer of fear for my daytoday at work or leaving the house

Getting MMR booster vaccine while on Skyrizi,"Im on Skyrizi for Crohns Started  year ago

I did a blood test recently that showed Im not within the normal range for immunity to measles mumps etc

Turns out I only received x MMR vaccine  years ago Ideally I really should get the second one to have immunity within normal vaccinated range

Of course as expected the GI specialist gives a blanket should try to avoid live vaccines and it makes sense but I also talked to a virologist at a hospital and she said that she has seen patients get the MMR vaccine while on Skyrizi and other biologics too

She said timing matters like it should obviously be in between Skyrizi doses The main uncertainty is whether  weeks after a Skyrizi dose and  weeks before the next dose would make sense Im on Skyrizi every  weeks If I do it in the middle it should be OK

Secondly since I already received x MMR dose so my body in theory should already be familar with it so its probably less likely it would overwhelm the body At least this is my reasoning

Third Im traveling to an area that has a small measles outbreak so ideally I would have the full protection

I also lost  pounds rather quickly fluctuating now after being at a steady weight for almost a year waiting to be medicated

I will say I was already dealing with muscle weakness exercise intolerance constipation and and random body pain before I started skyrizi but I feel like my bad days have become worse and more frequent and more issues with my health are popping up I also found out I have ppm methane SIBO 

My GI who is does not seem to give a lot of thought to my situation said we could switch biologics but I dont feel like a lot of symptoms are from skyrizi I feel like theres something else going on in my body and my immune system being compromised is making it worse My last scope confirmed that my inflammation has gone down but im not in remission I believe I have a mildmoderate case of crohns I dont want to switch if its working to take the inflammation down and restart the whole process of taking a biologic esp when biologics all work to suppress your immune system and skyrizi is known to be one of the ones with less side effects

A couple of questions,"Hi folks new here

Ive recently had a FIT test Ive been bleeding really quite a lot and honestly ignored it for too long thinking it was likely hemorrhoids until it was every time I went for to loo even just for a wee and it was over  Ive had an urgent referral to check for cancer due to this

I also had a calprotectin test and that was  and I have a telephone appointment with the nurse next week

Im trying to stay positive on the cancer front as I think I may have crohns as I became lactose intolerant a few years ago and I havent been able to eat a few foods for a while now without feeling ill and emptying my bowels Its possibly just food intolerances of course but IBD seemed more likely I thought

My questions though are two things 

Firstly I had an appointment with the nurse from the FIT test referral and they dont want to do any intrusive tests such as colonoscopy or endoscopy due to other health issues as they think it will make me unwell Realistically though Ive read that the CT scan what they want to do is likely to miss both cancer and IBD Is this correct in peoples experiences Should I push for a colonoscopy 
Is an MRI better than CT scan for these conditions Im having one on my spine during the same stay in hospital so they may just do one at the same time if so

Secondly does anybody ever not feel unwell until the next day after eating I usually start feeling it that night after dinner but sometimes it doesnt seem to start until the next morning around am Is this normal Or could it be that my breakfast same every day  weetabix and soya milk bothers me one day but not the next

Travel Insurance - Stricture v Obstruction.,"Hi all

I wondered if anyone can help me regarding travel insurance options

I am visiting the USA in a few months for one week and looking at travel insurance

When declaring previous conditions I am asked if I have had a bowel obstruction I have had strictures which I understand are narrowings but not a full obstruction 

Is a stricture classed as a bowel obstruction and I should therefore declare this

I cannot see any options to choose structure 

I have played around and it seems that if I do declare a bowel obstruction it shoots the amount to nearly  whereas without 

Obviously if I need to I will declare a bowel obstruction and pay the cost but on my Dr notes I can only see stricture noted

Need advice: Pill Cam stuck in colon,"hi everyone

first off not trying to ask for medical advice just looking for any suggestions based on shared experiences Ive tried to reach my doctor all day today and wasnt able to so im writing this post also to vent 

Im f really at a loss for what to do right now Any advice from anyone who has had a pill cam or is knowledge about blockages would be greatly appreciated

My GI sent me in for xray yesterday to check for a blockage after I called to let her know that I havent been able to have a bowel movement since my Pill cam was last Thursday Ive experienced a big increase in vomiting nausea pain stomach sounds and lack of appetite ive lost five pounds in five days

I got the xray results back today and lo and behold the capsule is stuck in the lower left colon My GI doctor said that this is significantly delayed transit as it has been five days

However there was no proposed plan on how to treat it I got the message on my patient portal at pm telling me about the xray results but all my doctor said in addition is that they want to put me on a new medication not a laxative a gastroperisis drug from Canada 

I wrote back asking what I should do as of right now as my symptoms are still present and urgent and got nothing back 

Im at a loss When they had gone over the risks of a pill cam before i did it they had said that if i got stuck they would probably need to do a procedure or surgery but nothing was mentioned at all today

Should I go to the ER Or should it be fine for a few more days My symptoms have come and go but they are daily and getting worse Dont want to overreact but worried about just leaving it",2025-02-26 23:49:15,327,hi everyone first trying ask medical advice looking suggestion based shared experience tried reach doctor day today able writing post also vent f really loss right advice anyone pill cam knowledge blockage would greatly appreciated gi sent xray yesterday check blockage called let know able bowel movement since pill cam last thursday experienced big increase vomiting nausea pain stomach sound lack appetite lost five pound five day got xray result back today lo behold capsule stuck lower left colon gi doctor said significantly delayed transit five day however proposed plan treat got message patient portal pm telling xray result doctor said addition want put new medication laxative gastroperisis drug canada wrote back asking right symptom still present urgent got nothing back loss gone risk pill cam said got stuck would probably need procedure surgery nothing mentioned today go er fine day symptom come go daily getting worse want overreact worried leaving,Negativo,-0.8979,Negativo
"15m, recently diagnosed with Crohns as well as Gastritis","My life was already very complicated before my diagnosis a few weeks ago My dad is in the state department so my life has been abnormal since we started moving around the world when I was around  Then a few months ago I showed symptoms for a GI problem and  weeks ago I got diagnosed with Crohns and Gastritis I also am currently anemic We were living in Morocco at the time and I had to get medically evacuated to London from late January to up until last week Then we decided its best to go to the US where Im from to receive treatment Im currently on prednisone as well as other antibiotics and general pill Ive recovered from my state a few weeks ago which was apparently pretty horrible according to my doctors  though I dont remember much

I was expecting to have diarrhoea a day after because Ive had this done before but  days later Im still struggling with diarrhoea worsened nausea and worse pain

"Balloon dilation for old stricture, any success stories?","Hello all Ive been diagnosed with Crohns for  years now almost exactly  years ago I had a bowel resection and Ive been in mostly good health ever since The only issues Ive had are numerous partial blockages due to scarring from the surgery which created a stricture in my terminal ileum I would say that within the last  years Ive had about    painful partial blockages with about  of them sending me to the hospital the other  I suffered through at home all resolved without additional surgery

I am extremely careful with what I eat nothing spicy nothing too bulky think raw carrots and as long as nothing gets stuck I have minimal issues on a daily basis sure Im in the bathroom way more than your average nonCrohns person and things arent always as formed as a normal bowel movement but I have no pain or discomfort Im currently on Enyvio every  weeks and my most recent colonoscopy showed minimal inflammation

My GI is concerned about the stricture in my terminal ileum even though its been mostly unchanged over the years He is proposing that we try the balloon dilation on it over two separate sessions to try opening it up some more As I said I am extremely careful with my diet and as long as I dont eat something to cause a blockage Id go about my day pain and discomfort free Right now Ive got two appointments on the books for April and May to give the dilation a shot but Im wondering if I should even take the risk Im fine controlling my diet and the stricture has been relatively unchanged for  or so years My last partial blockage was over  years ago

So I guess Im wondering if this balloon dilation would be a good thing to try on really old scar tissue My doc says that there is like a  chance of a rupture and I dont love that statistic  but he says spreading out the procedure over  visits should minimize the risk Should I really poke the bear stricture if Im generally okay on a day to day basis",2025-02-25 19:50:40,370,hello diagnosed crohn year almost exactly year ago bowel resection mostly good health ever since issue numerous partial blockage due scarring surgery created stricture terminal ileum would say within last year painful partial blockage sending hospital suffered home resolved without additional surgery extremely careful eat nothing spicy nothing bulky think raw carrot long nothing get stuck minimal issue daily basis sure bathroom way average noncrohns person thing always formed normal bowel movement pain discomfort currently enyvio every week recent colonoscopy showed minimal inflammation gi concerned stricture terminal ileum even though mostly unchanged year proposing try balloon dilation two separate session try opening said extremely careful diet long eat something cause blockage go day pain discomfort free right got two appointment book april may give dilation shot wondering even take risk fine controlling diet stricture relatively unchanged year last partial blockage year ago guess wondering balloon dilation would good thing try really old scar tissue doc say like chance rupture love statistic say spreading procedure visit minimize risk really poke bear stricture generally okay day day basis,Negativo,-0.8315,Neutro
Stelara wearing off after 5 weeks....what do i try next? This girl is so stuck,"Hi everyone i am looking for some support and reassurance andhopefully someone can point me towards the right path I have tried numerous meds after my longterm treatment became ineffective and nothing seems to stick I am running out of options 

I   F have had crohns since aged   diagnosed aged  via emergency resection For the past  years i have been struggling to find a treatment that will afford me any semblance of health After my surgery i tried Mesalamine Pentasa which didnt work I moved on to ImuranAzothioprine and had  years of good health with the occasional budensonide regime  In this time i graduated and began working i lived a normal life 

About  years ago i really flared   severe inflammation and strictures I tried Budensonide for  months  it didnt help  My ImuranAzothioprine was stopped as it was harming my liver I was given prednisolone Steroid and Humira antiTNF biologic and felt great for  months My symptoms came back after as i developed antibodies to  Humira This time the pred didnt help i started at mg taper and i would flare again if i tapered to less than mg I was on pred  months   I stopped pred in Novemberdue to the mental health impact 

I have been on Stelara since my loading dose in July The stelara was a slowburner the loading dose and initial  weeks injections didnt help  I now receive this every  weeks It helps but my symptoms come back after  weeks 

I dont know what to do anymore I am in the UK the NHS isnt keen on conducting a colonoscopy if i am not losing blood overshare since we are friends and family here xx   I know there are other therapies but my IBD nurse said they may be harmful in pregnancy Skyrizi rinvoq ect This makes me so miserable  i want to have a family in the next few years

Bad entyvio side effects,"Hi everyone

Im reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience or can offer some insight About  weeks ago I began treatment with Entyvio vedolizumab for my crohns Approximately a week after my first infusion I started experiencing a range of distressing symptoms
		Severe dizziness Even when lying still I  feel intense vertigo
		Tremors Uncontrollable shaking especially at night
		Numbness in legs A sensation as if my legs are almost numb
		Nausea Persistent feelings of sickness as if i have a very bad flu
		Profound fatigue An overwhelming sense of lifelessness and exhaustion Along with very bad anxiety

These symptoms have been persistent for the past  weeks and its been incredibly challenging I had hoped they might subside over time but that hasnt been the case Some days i feel a bit better but mostly have been bed bound 

I did have a budesonide treatment prior to starting Entyvio but I discontinued it five weeks ago Given the timeline Im inclined to believe that Entyvio might be the culprit

Has anyone else experienced similar side effects with Entyvio Could these symptoms be related to the medication even after this duration Any insights or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated

Vent.. sorry.,"While I understand care and concern from family Im being told I need to do more and try holistic and herbal approaches for this disease Its overwhelming because they said they looked it up and I need to be doing more to get my stamina back after having my rectum removed at the end of  Ive started trying to walk more and be active but its exhausting While yes my stamina is better than when I lost it initially its nowhere near where it was before the surgery I cant stand or sit for long it feel like I will pass out Also I do have an ileostomy and I do struggle with dehydration even though I drink more than enough fluids I would like to try anything that can help

Id like to add its frustrating because many of my experiences are always overlooked by people including doctors They said I should be back to normal  months to a year after surgery and Im barely getting my footing now So its hard to explain to my family that I am trying but Crohns is so unpredictable I feel like shit most of the time I try not to push myself because when I do and when I have I end up more fucked off than before While people around me understand this disease is bad Ive come to the realization that they also think its not as bad as I make it seem They often give me advice that I know will not help but if I dont appease them they may think Im full of it I try to get my family to read real experiences from the different groups Im in on social media so they can see from real people with real experiences what its like but in response I get told you arent those people or you dont know if theyre trying or what theyve tried I know its not coming from a harsh place but a place of care I know that theyve watch me fall apart for a long time now and are scared of if Ill live a long quality life Its just frustrating

Biologic stopped,"Hi I hope everyone is doing ok Im so sorry for the long post 

I have had chrons since  I was on infliximab and steroids but infliximab stopped working my body could not hold onto any medication I was then put on Stelara last year which put me into clinical remission but I developed drug induced lupus and finally in Jan  they stopped the biologic due to the side effects The only up side was as soon as I would take the injection my incontinence would stop and I would have normal type  bowel motions My consultant told me they will not put me on another biologic unless i go into a clinical flare

My issue is Im still having severe incontinence multiple type  bowel motions a day Its been  weeks since the last injection though I started getting issues around the  week mark 
I had an xray and they told me I had faecal loading And that my incontinence is probably overflow I took the  sachets of laxatives that they prescribed and its just type  all the time which is fair enough as its a huge amount of sodium and potassium for my body to deal with I was half expecting a formed stool to come out I stopped the laxatives but Im still having type  stools  times a day

Its ruining my life Ive had to cancel so many things because right now I cannot leave my flat Im so scared to go out because I have no idea when Im going to be incontinent its literally a split second notice and I still dont make it to the toilet Luckily atm Im on annual leave If Im at work I have to wear incontinence pants The ibd nurse told me they are still refusing to put me on another biologic as my calprotectin is low And I quote people do come off the biologics after I argued I thought biologics were for life and that its low because of the biologic

They are now saying its an ibs flare Ive had ibs for more than  years and never been incontinent with it I used to take codeine and Imodium if I ever had loose stools but neither of them touch me since I was diagnosed with chrons 

I cant eat properly Im down to one meal a day food either goes straight through me or my stomach shuts down and the food I ate in the morning I will vomit up  hours later I react with all foods now even with my safe foods The bloating is so severe I asked them to test me for SIBO but they still said it was an ibs flare Bizarrely Im not losing weight but seem full of fluid Even my diuretics have stopped working I have kidney disease

A cure for IBD,"Interesting article in New Scientist mag yesterday about new treatments for autoimmune diseases including IBD that might offer a cure I got ChatGPT AI to summarise it 

The article from New Scientist explores groundbreaking therapies that aim to cure autoimmune diseases by reprogramming the immune system potentially offering lasting relief for conditions like type  diabetes multiple sclerosis lupus and inflammatory bowel disease

Key Points

 Background on Autoimmune Diseases
Autoimmune diseases arise when the immune system mistakenly attacks the bodys own cells due to faulty B and Tcells Current treatments such as immunosuppressants only alleviate symptoms but leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer


 New Approaches to Treatment

CART Therapy Originally used in cancer treatment this approach involves modifying Tcells to eliminate malfunctioning immune cells Early trials in lupus patients show that a single treatment can induce longterm remission

Navacims Nanomedicines Developed by immunologist Pere Santamaria these tiny particles reprogram faulty immune cells to suppress rather than promote autoimmunity Trials show promise in diseases like type  diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis

LiverBased Tolerance Therapy Researchers exploit the livers natural ability to suppress immune reactions by designing inverse vaccines which retrain the immune system to tolerate specific selfantigens This method has shown success in reversing symptoms in animal models

mRNABased Therapies Inspired by COVID vaccine technology researchers are exploring mRNA treatments that could instruct the body to generate immuneregulating cells preventing attacks on selfantigens

 Challenges and Outlook

While these therapies are promising they come with risks including potential infections and high costs CART therapy costs over  per treatment

Longterm effects remain unclear requiring further clinical trials

Despite these hurdles scientists are optimistic that these new treatments could provide a longterm solution replacing broad immunosuppression with precise immune correction

The article concludes with cautious optimism suggesting that after decades of research a true cure for autoimmune diseases may soon be within reach

"I don't recognize myself, pls share tips and your experiences","Hi all female yo here 

I had no clue i had this and the past  years were hell

I gradually turned from this energetic spark of life to an extreme recluse with zero confidencebc embarrassing stuff keep happening and Im a grown ass woman  at this point I dont even have pride to feel like an adult anymore 

 I lost opportunities at my job bc Id rather avoid meeting ppl or even a manager person to person to save face I flat out stopped socializing with colleagues bc Im embarrassed 

I lost friends some i purposely pushed away bc i loved meeting up but now i dread it again to save face I dropped approaching many ppl I found interesting which sucks 

I loved being a busy body now I order every single thing online if not I have someone get it for me and I rather pay even when Im broke

I stopped traveling if I go out I stay in my car and avoid interaction with ppl I am physically avoiding my family who live in the same house i literally just text them I stopped initiating activities involving ppl in fear of shame 

I guess after writing all this no wonder I dont recognize myself i got put in a box

all I could do is postpone my life until I figure out whats wrong with me

My day and night is spent researching because Drs dont know shit I myself requested the tests to be done and not only did I find out I have this I also have hashimoto and nodules and fibroid Im still suspecting few other things to be tested 

Is this familiar at all to you guys Or am I just an idiot whos completely mishandling this here

Pain temp help,"Just wanted to share a few things Ive learned in the past few years that are helpful in reducing pain
 Gas pills Sometimes the pain is gas If this is the case its helpful to stand and twist your torso left and right for a few minutes
 Massager of any kind This helps me the most when I feel like something is tight twisting in my abdomen If I hold the electric massager on that spot of my belly the pain reduces over time 
 TENS unit This works the same way as massage Put the pads on your abdomen when it hurts the most and put your unit on low for as long as you can near it 
 Ginger chews These seem to help with extreme nausea 
 Heated blanket covering the back and abdomen can help me fall asleep when I am in so much pain
 Laxatives like lactose can help rid the colon of stuck poop The emergency room said to keep taking the laxatives until your stool is runny

Can I stop treatment?

What are some negative outcomes of leaving Crohns untreated Mine is so mild that I dont think it really affects my daytoday at all and maybe I am already in remission  always have been before the bacterial infection

Some Good News...And a Lot of Questions (Inflammation),"I posted two weeks ago about a bad colonoscopy not helped by a worse doctor which at the time looked like I had cancer  The good news isI most likely dont  Second colonoscopy a few days ago this time with an experienced GI doctor and he confirmed what the first colonoscopy had found it was benign  He believes its an inflammatory polyp possibly caused by a flare I had last month that lasted about a week  After he said Im quite sure that you do not have cancer I felt like anything else was going to be a pleasant bonus  

So thats good but we agreed that were going to have to go harder than the budesonide  He wants me to take prednisone for about a month on a taper then do a CT scan to see if the polyp is gone and then make a decision on surgery or not surgery  After that its Remicade time  Theres only two problems  

Problem  my insurance company wont cover Remicade  Theyll only cover Stelara or Skyrizi  Not a huge problem Im willing to give either one a shot  Ive been reading the reviews here and they seem like good medicines one of my cousins is on Skyrizi for UC and she told me it was a lifechanger for the better  I think my GI doctor will be okay with that

Problem  I cant take prednisone  I have borderline personality disorder which means Im already subject to wild mood swings and sudden rages  If the steroid is going to turn that up to  I genuinely fear Im going to harm someone like my family or even myself  Im wondering if theres any alternatives to prednisone that dont cause roid rage

have been having nonstop terrible symptoms of pain nausea vomiting bowel issues etc and all of this happening daily at this point which is especially concerning with the vomiting

the worst is how i cant eat at all anymore i throw everything up or im severely nauseous for days everything hurts so much had to switch to a new dietician due to my my level of severity and she says im very malnourished and expressed how extremely concerned she is for my current state she says she would suggest looking into a tube

doctors have been putting me on different stomach motility meds was on reglan but had to go off due to tardive dyskinesia and i had a pill cam a couple days ago no results yet but my doctor straight up said she doesnt know if well find anything despite my extreme symptoms

seems she doesnt understand how bad my eating issues are cant drink ensure cause i throw it up my dietician is reaching out to my GI and says if i dont have any strictures she would suggest going forward with tubing me but my GI doctor has been dismissive so not hopeful

now they want to put me on a new gastroperisis drug that i have to get from canada and who knows how long that will take my dietician says that every week i feel like this is putting me in danger i spend all my days in bed or bathroom with nausea pain chills and hot flashes fainting episodes and with a doctor who seems not curious in exploring the causes despite her literally having diagnosed me with severe small bowel crohns a year ago and if this isnt by some weird occurrence due to my crohns then idk

my mom wants me to get a second opinion i dont know i have an appointment in a week with my doctors PA to go over the pill cam results

also im on remicade for almost a year now and dont know if its doing anything but my doctor has not brought up switching dont know if thats normal she says that my remicade should be helping my inflammation but i dont feel better at all

My partner just got diagnosed. How to prepare for infusions and being immunocompromised?,"Hey everyone

My partner lets called them Alex theythem recently got diagnosed with Chrohns Theyre currently taking Endocort for it as a three month course and waiting to start infusions of immunosuppressive therapy in about  weeks 

In terms of being more illnessconscious  

Weve told their family who we visit often that theyll need to let us know if anyone has been sick because itll be riskier for Alex to be getting sick They already often get sick more often and for longer than the regular  something 

we also plan to get KNs for group settings and public transit and be more mindful about washing our hands more often We also plan to ask guests each visit if theyve been sick recently or around sick people recently 

Additionally Ill be putting in subtle hints to their family to get regular flu vaccines theyre free where we live and doing this myself I also have an appointment with my doctor to make sure Im up to date on vaccines and Alex has an referall with an immunity specialist to talk about necessary vaccines but we dont know when thatll be

Im wondering 

What more can we do 
Are there ways I can support a more GI friendly diet for them subtly 
How can I make their first infusion experience better besides coming along What did you wish you knew before your first infusion

Im due to start Stelara in  weeks I just need to finish my TB treatment first Im currently on mg of budesonide to control my Crohns and its always been pretty good at it A few months ago my GI gave me an emergency dose of Prednisone in case I have a bad flare Its a weeks worth of mg a day that has been sat in the emergency box

I was diagnosed in August  and this is the first real flare Ive had My Crohns has always felt mild and it only ever hurt if I poked my ileum However its been  days of twisting bowel pain nausea no vomiting zero appetite frequent toilet visits red poo massive fatigue acid reflux etc

I feel a bit better today pain wise but Im not convinced its going to go away just yet So my questions are

 If I take the prednisone for a week should I stop the budesonide In my mind it seems like an eitheror situation
 Is a  week dose long enough to get the nasty side effects Ive never taken it before but Im aware its not supposed to be pleasant

I was hoping it would just go away on its own to be honest and that it was probably caused by something I ate last week I wasnt even considering the prednisone but Im starting to get sick of feeling this way

Remsima Subcut recurring hives,"Hey fellow crohnies On May  i switched from Remicade infusions to Remsima subcut and even though i cant clearly remember when exactly it started it must have been around  months where i started having hives i wasnt getting hives before

I take antihistamines the day of the injection yet the hives appear some days later at the area injected it also happens randomly at random spots that i feel itchy and they appear especially after i scratch i also get very itchy mostly at night there are specific spots where this happens mostly at past injection spots but also at some places at my arms or behind my legs

  
Sadly i dont have health insurance live in a rural area and its both difficult and expensive to get a checkup

Ive tried researching a million times but i cant find much info apart that its a side effect of Crohns in general but no info specifically on the correlation of remsima subcut with hives

I have no other side effects apart from thesei am in remission and have been for around  years

Has anyone else experienced this

Is this a normal thing that i must just learn how to live with or can this be an allergic reaction

Erythema Nodosum & Arthritis,"Hello 

Im F and was diagnosed with Crohns  years ago It was mild when we caught it thankfully I also have hidradenitis suppurativa Ive been on Humira for about  years and was in remission for a very long time

About a year ago I fell into a really depressive episode and stopped taking my Humira It was a mix of not wanting to take care of myself and then feeling shame about missing doses Luckily I have a good support system and found a new therapist and am doing much better I have been back on my Humira since August I was off for a few months

Ive already beat myself up a lot about what a stupid decision that was so please no comments about that Depression is an asshole

Anyway  last year at the end of June I noticed red bumps on my leg I bounced around between GI and derm I had a biopsy in July and it was confirmed to be erythema eodosum I did a month of prednisone My last week of the taper the spots came back so I was put on  more weeks I was also back on Humira now A few weeks later the spots came back again I reached out to my GI again He said since my Crohns was in remission GI wise it wasnt related My last scope was in  so this was based on CRP and fecal calprotectin 

My PCP did a bunch of blood tests Positive ANA which Ive had before All the other rheum stuff was negative I was sent to the HS clinic at derm because they thought they somehow might be related They said they cant really tell me why it happens At this point it is midJanuary Ive had EN since late June They wanted to put me on hydroxychloroquine but that is a nono with Lexapro so they started me on Colchicine Ive also been having knee ankle and low back pain They ordered some xrays and referred me to rheumatology

Rheum sent me for an ultrasound of knees and ankles Said the EN was likely Crohns related My knee ultrasound showed Small anterior joint effusion bilaterally Mild quadriceps tendinosis with small enthesophyte formation at the insertion bilaterally and a small Baker cyst on my right knee Small effusion on my ankle Back xray showed Minimal bilateral subchondral sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints favored to be mechanical

Because there was no active inflammation shown in my joints rheum said it was most likely wear  tear She maybe I had a small flare last year and that caused the EN She did not recommend any changes to my treatment Said pain in my knees is osteoarthritis and bone spurs 

I really like my GI but I wonder if he was out of his depths He was not on the IBD team He is leaving in March so I have an appointment for someone on the IBD team so I have a doc but that isnt until July

Is it normal for EN to last for almost  months Im finally seeing the spots go down with the new meds It is making me feel like they think I want to be sick and am overreacting It just seems weird to me to have a diagnosis of Crohns have EN and arthritis symptoms and its just meh wear and tear youre getting older

Mesenteric-based surgery shows promise for Crohn's,"A new international study published in the journal Gastroenterology has shown that the approach first developed in University of Limerick UL and University Hospital Limerick UHL by Professor of Surgery J Calvin Coffey and his research team could have a major impact on treating Crohns disease 

Crohns disease is incurable with high rates of recurrence even after surgery It is a condition for which at least  of patients will require surgery to treat at some point To add to this around  of those will require repeat surgery However the new approach pioneered at UL and UHL dramatically reduces the possibility that followup surgery will be needed to as few as approximately  of patients 

The new surgical approach requires removal of the mesentery  which was reclassified as a new organ following discoveries by Professor Coffeys team and collaborators in  It builds on the scientific advances the group made on the mesentery an organ in which all digestive organs of the abdomen develop and then remain connected to 

The international trial  has validated the approach used by Professor Coffey and colleagues which could be very significant for treating Crohns disease Crohns disease has a terrible impact on patients lives said Professor Coffey who is Foundation Chair of Surgery at ULs School of Medicine and Consultant General and Colorectal Surgeon at UHL Surgery is required as often as it is because the medical treatments used against Crohns disease cannot stop progression of the disease in most patients This is despite nearly a century of intensive research in this field 

Using the advances made in our understanding of the mesentery however the new surgical approach removes the mesentery which adjoins the diseased intestine Prior to this technique the convention among surgeons was to leave the mesentery in part because removing it is technically challenging The safe removal of the mesentery in Crohns disease was helped by the advances made in our understanding of the mesentery at UHL and UL explained Professor Coffey The results of this trial are clear evidence of the direct impact the discoveries on the mesentery have had in the clinical and scientific setting

Had a colonoscopy last week…,"How long did it take you guys to get results I just had my colonoscopy a little over a week ago I feel like most signs point to Crohns though I feel like there could be a lot of shared symptoms 

Backstory my bowel movements most of my life have been diarrhea I am now  for reference Ive experienced pain and discomfort but I also tend to ignore pain and just let things go Over the last few years I have noticed a huge increase in symptoms Diarrhea  times per day blood almost every time and sometimes a layer of mucous around it like a casing its super weird I go through periods where I feel ok and then seemingly unwarranted flare ups sometimes just a little bloating sometimes it feels like a full body reaction causing fatigue joint pain and swelling all over my body specifically in my hands and face Im almost always in a constant state of abdominal discomfort sometimes a dull ache and sometimes its agonizing radiating from my knees up to my kidneys Speaking of kidneys Ive recently started to feel what I think might be kidney stones Ill feel an ache in my kidneys and most recently I believe I passed a small stone as I felt a stink when I peed that lasted only a day then it was gone I get heart burn regularly During flares I have no appetite and lose  pounds after flares I get my appetite back and regain to my maintenance weight so though I experience weight loss its only during flares I also get faint very easily almost every time I stand and get extremely cold Every time I eat I feel a very uncomfortable fullness which has sometimes caused me to just avoid eating because I dont want to feel like that Ive done the elimination diet and not a single thing points to any specific type of food that causes these flare ups They just happen when they happen 

All of my bloodwork came back normal with no signs of celiac disease I will add that I have had three kids so of course I have hemorrhoids but I do not think they could cause all of this And I can tell when they are flared up its just not the same thing I got an initial summary of my colonoscopy today and it just says diagnosis hemorrhoids I know they took biopsies in there and I dont believe those results have come in yet they also stated that they wouldnt post those results in the patient portal they would speak to me personally at my follow up appointment which is coming up on March th Im just going crazy sitting here thinking after all this Im only going to get diagnosed with hemorrhoids Not that I want Crohns disease I just want an answer that makes sense and to finally find a course of treatment cause its been a long time of feeling absolutely dreadful I just want answers I already have anxiety but now just sitting here ruminating in this has me going crazy Sorry for the long post",2025-02-20 04:33:02,529,long take guy get result colonoscopy little week ago feel like sign point crohn though feel like could lot shared symptom backstory bowel movement life diarrhea reference experienced pain discomfort also tend ignore pain let thing go last year noticed huge increase symptom diarrhea time per day blood almost every time sometimes layer mucous around like casing super weird go period feel ok seemingly unwarranted flare ups sometimes little bloating sometimes feel like full body reaction causing fatigue joint pain swelling body specifically hand face almost always constant state abdominal discomfort sometimes dull ache sometimes agonizing radiating knee kidney speaking kidney recently started feel think might kidney stone feel ache kidney recently believe passed small stone felt stink peed lasted day gone get heart burn regularly flare appetite lose pound flare get appetite back regain maintenance weight though experience weight loss flare also get faint easily almost every time stand get extremely cold every time eat feel uncomfortable fullness sometimes caused avoid eating want feel like done elimination diet single thing point specific type food cause flare ups happen happen bloodwork came back normal sign celiac disease add three kid course hemorrhoid think could cause tell flared thing got initial summary colonoscopy today say diagnosis hemorrhoid know took biopsy believe result come yet also stated post result patient portal would speak personally follow appointment coming march th going sitting thinking going get diagnosed hemorrhoid want crohn disease want answer make sense finally find course treatment cause long time feeling absolutely dreadful want answer already anxiety sitting ruminating going sorry long post,Negativo,-0.9935,Neutro

Horrible colonoscopy experience after one that wasn't too bad.,"I had a perforated bowel back in May likely due to crohns and was lucky I healed on my own basically It was my first flare up and I got two perforations It took me a while to go into the hospital and my bowel had already started healing so they gave me antibiotics until I healed up allowing me to keep my bowel Inflammation actually improved a lot and when I had a colonoscopy  weeks later there was little inflammation biopsies showed mild inflammation So the report just showed mild inflammation colitis and not much else I had no problem it was painful but it was a pain I could deal with and I just chilled with the gas no problem After I had some pain but nothing serious

This time round they booked another colonoscopy I had quite bad inflammation and I thought great now they can actually capture it When I got there I was pretty bad but when he stuck his finger in to apply lube I knew I had made a mistake I was instantly in agony stinging so much I recoiled and whenever he touched me I reflexively jumped They gave me pain killers before going in and they did little to help I was shaking like a leaf the entire time Inside I could see on the camera that it was very inflamed with bulbous parts and soreness it looked like a veiny alien planet and I was in agony This time he brought in a consultant to look It looked different to last time and was clear that this time it captured it I was trying my best to use gas and air but I dissociated and felt the pain all over my body I cant explain how traumatic the experience was I told them to take biopsies ASAP because I couldnt put up with it They continued and managed to get two biopsies from the worst areas before I told them to stop and pull it out I could not continue I was SHAKING the whole time and had tears in my eyes I felt sick

The camera was shredding my intestinal mucosal lining and after when I went to the toilet it came out with blood This also happened with my perforated bowel

And today the next day I feel very ill I had a fever and my stomach pain is bad I also feel weird similar to when I had my perforation but not as bad Im kind of anxious now that it couldve caused a perforation It was already bad is it possible it caused a perforation I know its unlikely but with the symptoms and the absolute agony I was in maybe its more likely BUT Im also very anxious especially after my perforation in the past Its made me more health conscious So maybe Im worrying over nothing

My mom stared making beef broth with vegetables squash chayote green beans celery couple potatoes celery cauliflower cilantro beef chunks with the bone and salt We would blend it real well I blend my scrambled eggs and add some tomato onion and spinach to it I blend fruis too like papaya a banana kiwi and an apple I was super constipated and after the rd day of this diet I started to pass stool easier Eventually the brain fog was less and started going to the gym again feeling stronger than other remissions I almost dont experience depression anymore also My whole body was so nutrient deprived but helping digestion by blending nutritious food made all the difference

"long post , so lost","Summer of 
 Symptoms first begin most obvious was frequent loud burns 
 Terrible gas
 Heartburnindigestiob
 Was regularly smoking had been for about a year
 wet cough after eating 

November of 
 NSAID overdose caused horrible stomach pain dry heaving burping could not eat anything loss of appetite fatigue 
 Stopped smoking after this 
 Could not stomach food or liquids early satiety
 Debilitating nausea and pain in the morning had to take warm bath to ease it
 Was prescribed lansoprazole but did not notice any change in the nausea cramping or burping indigestion and heartburn was alleviated a little 
 After not being able to eat anything and was having sips of water went to ER and was given IV for dehydration and anti nausea meds diagnosed with CHS

  Symptoms continued but milder suspected it was due to quitting smoking and beggining treatment for anxiety  depression therapy  sertaline

December 
 Woke up with excruciating stomach pain on Christmas day family was opening presents but I was sitting crying with a heating pad from pain could not eat anything felt like I was being stabbed
 Ended up going to work and getting sent home by my boss because I could could only stand crouched over
 Took gravol  melatonin and slept for  days the pain from xmas eve was gone but other symptoms remained 
 Dont know if its relevant but I had some sort of stomach bug  weeks after  members of my family had it but they got it days apart from me

 Since then symptoms have been on and off I am able to stomach more food but still have early satiety and no appetite 
 I typically only eat dinner because I am around my family and when I do not eat it causes extreme conflict even though i explain how nauseous and painful it is 
 If i do crave anything its fatty fast food but that just makes me feel more sick 
 I have frequent loud burps on emptyfull stomach i sound like that one scene from the elf find myself pushing stuck burps out of my throat which are silent 
 Loss of appetite Indigestion burning sensation in stomach stabbing cramps in middle of abdomen under ribs and to the left super loud stomach when empty or after digesting anything weird vibrating feeling
 popping sensation in stomach from gas irregular bowel movements every days also can not involuntary fart I have to force gas out i feel grumbling in my pelvis too
 Overall fatigue dizziness muscle weakness limbs going numb always cold but episodes of hot flashes excessive sweating headaches dont feel pleasure anymore horrible migraines  light sensitivity 
 heart palpitations RHR is at least  chest pain tightness 
 I rely on gravol to get through the day even though it doesnt do much when nauseous at home I often take the drowsy gravol however avoid it bc it was making me sleep excessively and needed time for school work  my pt job
 I crave rly cold food dont know if this means anything I only drink ice cold water

This past weekend I woke up feeling intense cramping and burning in my stomach I had a fever of  sun  night reaching  mon  afternoin All i ate was some fruit and have been trying to drink peppermint tea I began having really bad chest pain aching pain in left arm but it only lasted a day
It has been  days and the nausea has not subsided I ate my first meal with my family it was a baked pasta dish and even though I had a small portion I feel so incredibly sick After eating I was burping nauseous cramps bubbling sensation of gas in stomach all normal even got some regurgitated food when burping 
There has been  or  times where I was forcing myself to puke to ease the nausea but have since stopped out of fears to oral health This time I puked involuntarily and felt an intense burning in my throat I even recently feel like I cannot swallow pills or my own saliva without drinking water  
These attacks keep coming out of no where and I havent seemed to find a culprit

I have lost over  lbs and I was already on the lower side of my weight range I am  I have an appointment with my GP but im so hopeless because they keep pinning everything to anxiety and depression I am currently on mg Wellbutrin and mg of lexapro so they are both being treated the only thing i notice is when I get anxious i can feel my stomach burning Ive always had bad period cramps so I take naproxen but havent got my period in  months I take ibuprofen for bad migraines I take iron and magnesium supplements as directed by my GP 

TLDR Experiencing symptoms since summer  nausea cramps indigestion reflux gas infrequent bowel movements no appetite  malaise heart palpitations and chest pain 

Ruined my relationship with mom who thinks I am lying and says shes tired of my whining Missed sm school and grades have suffered  I am supposed to talk to my doctor soon but I am hopeless that it will only end in blaming my anxiety and not eating I am going to start keeping a food diary and track symptoms  bowel movements

“Glow up” after developing crohns,"Hey guys Wondering if anyone has experienced a similar thing as me Since developing crohns ive had as described by others a glowup Its a really weird thing to experience because while my selfconfidence is probably the best its ever been i feel the worst i ever have 

Im a  yo female and i first developed crohns at  my sophomore year of college I was by no means overweight but the freshman  definitely hit hard I didnt like my body or really my face and i just wasnt super confident in myself Well
after the crohns came along i lost  lbs in a few months sidenote the amount of eating disorder rumors that were started about me is wild But losing that weight put me at a weight that is very physically desirable to other people 

I havent put any weight back on since then but i just started medication so hopefully that will start soon but the whole thing is such a mental battle I love how my body looks right now but I hate the suffering ive gone through to cause it Ive had people say to me i wish i would get crohns to get that skinny with no work which makes me so mad to hear But theres people who dont really know what ive been through and say like oh wow you look so much better youve had such a glow up and i just wanna be like thanks i developed a chronic illness

Update: Stoping Entyvio/Infusions,"This is for anyone who was curious from my last post I got a lot of feedback so I wanted to put out my plan after talking with my GI and PCP about stopping infusions to see if itll help my constipation 

My GI suggested taking a pause but not completely stopping They want to see how I do and see if it is the Entyvio causing my constipation or if its something else They suggested a  cycle pause and have a follow up with them on each of the weeks I was supposed to have my infusion 

I am also seeing a nutritionist starting tomorrow to get a set diet while on this trial And to start Magnesium Glycinate to see if that helps my bowel movements Also a new laxative I have yet to try because pharmacy is out of it right now

There has not been talk about rescoping me yet which Im okay with because Id rather do this trial of pausing first then Id get scoped again after if needed 

I understand a few or a lot of readers wont agree with pausing or stopping infusions Thats okay we are all different and we are all trying to see what works for us I always appreciate the feedback and concern This community really gets me through some rough times

Is anyone else tired of unsolicited advice?,"I have a friend who is passionate about supplements and herbal remedies They constantly say how there is a natural cure for everything and how they dont want you to know about it because its free and big pharma wants your money One of the frustrating things about that is that were in the UK so we dont have to pay for healthcare if not getting private treatment and whenever I talk about herbs and ingredients that can be found through foraging I dont actually do this anymore but just talk about it to add to the conversation they ignore me and just talk about how the supplements are enough So they dont want the free foraged ingredients but would pay the companies that sell supplements claiming to fix different ailments 

Whats especially frustrating is that for over  years natural remedies and holistic practises were my own passion and I tried to help my unusual symptoms that several years later were due to Crohns when I finally got diagnosed by using these things only to consistently be flaring and feeling bad every time I tried 

I met this person shortly after being diagnosed so they werent along with me on the journey of me having all of those weird symptoms and consistently doing these holistic clean eating habits so didnt know what Ive tested and tried out and how much effort I put into it None of it worked

Two viruses in two weeks (on Stelera),"So Ive been dealing with Crohns and am on Stelara which already makes my gut unpredictable But this past week has been a ride I somehow managed to get hit with two separate viruses within days of each other and both times I ended up vomiting bile after hours of nausea

First Virus 
		Started with mild nausea and bloating
		Woke up at  AM and proceeded to puke every  minutes for  hours straight
		The next day I was completely wiped out could barely move and had periodic diarrhea
		Water made my bloating worse and I could only lay on my left side
		No BMs for the next two days then a rollercoaster of weird bowel movements followed

Second Virus 
		Fatigue hit me like a truck  Sinus pain and nausea throughout the day No BMs
		By  PM I threw up bile againbut unlike last time it actually gave me relief for a few hours Unfortunately Im back to being miserable today after a night of horrific body aches

I know bile vomiting can happen when your stomach is empty but this pattern is bizarre Has anyone else experienced this with backtoback illnesses Could the Stelara be making viral infections hit me harder or is my gut just completely losing its ability to regulate

Google deepmind and Isomorphic labs,"Hello all

I hope you are all doing well Disclaimer im not a scientist or some crazy advocate for AI Im not one who thinks too optimistically but recently I found out about more about Google deepmind and isomorphic labs two companies founded by a Demis hassabi who won a Nobel prize in chemistry last year 

I know AI isnt the final solution to all of our problems and yes I know itll take even more time to figure out more about these conditions and diseases and yes I do know that these diseases are incredibly complex That being said there are some quite interesting things being developed in these past few years Alphafold a tool developed by deepmind has defined all the protein structures in nature  million whereas before experimental biologists in the last few decades were only able to define k Alphafold  which was relatively recently developed aims to understand how these proteins interact with other molecules 

Long story short call it wishful thinking but I do honestly believe these advancements hold the some potential to significantly reduce drug discovery time and can help identifying which proteins are specifically responsible for a multitude of diseases Another cool thing is that Demis decided to make all these  million known protein structures open sourceknown to the world so the entire world can basically work through these findings and help accelerate additional findings 

Isomorphic labs as far as I understand has the main objective of developing new medicine faster pretty much like way faster They too will also useleverage alphafold Basically they will use machine learning to predict how certain drugs will interact with these proteins in our bodies Isomorphic labs has recently this year partnered with Eli Lily and Novartis which are massive companies in the small molecule therapeutics space so stuff like for example JAK inhibitors instead of biologics Again Im not throwing shade on current solutions or saying this is gonna cure us all ffs Im currently on a biologic and Im perfectly find being so for the rest of my life and Im not complaining  Im just saying this shit is pretty cool and who knows it can potentially lead to some significant beneficial result

Pretty scared and tired,"Hi I dont usually post here but I guess Im just desperate at this point Im M and Ive been dealing with ongoing intestinal issues since  Mostly permanent constipation mixed with bouts of diarrhea and severe abdominal pain after eating They diagnosed me with a severe form of IBS back in  because all blood  fecal studies came back normal


 years later I got diagnosed with a rare metabolic disease that affects my muscle and my brain mitochondrial disease Also my bowel symptoms have worsened throughout all these years The diarrhea occured more often lasted more days had recurrent mouth sores during the flares combined with acid reflux They ran calprotectin test again  and it came back pretty high around  with positive ASCA IgG antibodies  and a normal MR enterography So the neuros agree that I probably suffer from crohns on top of it 


Now heres the thing every single GI refuses to treat me with a mere clinical diagnosis of crohns They want to do an endoscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies My metabolic disease puts me at an ENORMOUS risk for death before during and after the procedure I have respiratory weakness issues with clotting dysautonomia and issues swallowing which could cause aspiration and respiratory failure during the procedure plus hyperthermia induced by anesthesia The laxatives can induce a metabolic crisis before it and I can go into respiratory failure even a few days AFTER the procedure due to my body not being able to recover My neuro agrees that its nonsense to put me under so much stress to get a biopsy when theres no other viable diagnosis that the GIs have brought up 





I literally dont know what else to do I go to a GI  he says Im not medicating you without a biopsy  I leave Rinse and repeat

fast forward a little bit to midoctober and i have the capsule endoscopy performed  at that point everything was still up in the air as far as a diagnosis and i didnt have any treatment at that point  i was still getting either intermittent constipation or weird foulsmelling stools that floated and just gave me an overwhelming sense of abnormal  my mom tried to calm me down and told me that it was because i was so stressed out but id never experienced bowel habits like this in my life and sometimes id get such horrible cramps i was sure i was about to have the worst diarrhea of my life but it always ended up being those odd stools that looked sort of normal but always seemed to float no matter what  because i feel the need to research EVERYTHING i was sure that it had to be a sign of malabsorption and i was so freaked out

the capsule endoscopy showed no structuring erythema or other evidence of inflammation except five more ulcers all clustered right where the first one had been found in my terminal ileum  i was then diagnosed with ileitis and put on budesonide  mg which didnt seem to be doing much at first but now in retrospect i think i had a LOT less symptoms and only regretted it when i forgot to take my pantoprazole for a day and had to deal with subsequent rebound acid its so awful  i definitely still had some bad days that were  likely do to excessive stress

as of december  because i had been happy to report to my GI doc that i had been feeling better than i could remember in months he and his NP decided the next best course of action was to wean me off of the budesonide and begin to trial me on mesalamine  at this point i was actually terrified to switch medication because it seemed like they were pretty set on the fact that this looks like we caught chrons in its very very early stages  at first i was actually very angry because i was in denial and didnt want to believe it  why couldnt i just have nonspecific ileitis  werent my biopsies unremarkable besides mild inflammation  wasnt my bloodwork completely normal  my calprotectin was  but wasnt that just because of the ulcers  how many people could be walking around with ulcers in their intestines and never know it because nobody swallows a pillcam to scope out their GI tract on the regular  i kept spiraling and continued to spiral as i thought about what this could mean for the future

i still dont have a definitive diagnosis but as ive begun to wean off the budesonide i think ive been taking  mg since the end of january the effects have been slowly making themselves apparent  mesalamine has seemed to change my stools into something definitely more consistent albeit a little weird but always solid and no problems with odor or smell they were most like my usual normal on budesonide alone though  sometimes i get BMs that resemble a  or  on the stool chart but they are always strangely easy to pass and they return to normal in the next day or two

as far as my symptoms go i feel like im getting a lot more gas that im not really able to pass it feels like im digesting a brick and it just sits there feeling extremely bloated but not physically appearing so off and on stomach aches that feel like theres liquid fire in my stomach and small intestine and GERD that has come back with a vengeance despite taking pantoprazole  mg every day  i also feel like im getting more overactive bowel sounds again like i used to before i got on budesonide  i mostly just lie on the couch every evening just trying to find some way to be comfortable for at least  minutes  last night was the first time in what feels like forever that i was up all night with abdominal pain 

at this point i just feel so lost but also eager to find some other medication regime because i feel like now theres no denying it and i might as well be receptive to whatever plan gets me into and keeps me into remission  im so fucking sick of not feeling normal  im tired of my family making comments about me just needing to eat more  if they only knew how much id fucking love to try  i cant stand going to social events and watching people eat whatever the hell they want in such excessive amounts and then having to look down at my plate with toddlersized portions  i also cant even stomach anything to drink with any of my meals because it just feels like there is NOT ENOUGH room in my stomach for a normal amount of food let alone more liquid  its a fucking chore to even get  ounces of water in during the day  i feel best when i dont have anything in my stomach because i get extremely hungry yet half a sandwich is enough to fill me for six hours  and i essentially eat by the clock

just venting kind of as before  anyone else in the same boat or just recently diagnosed  i dont know what to do right now besides grin and bear it till my follow up appointment on feb th  a few of my family members friends and my boyfriend asked me why dont i call the doctor but im a medical assistant and kind of know how the standard doctors office works especially for specialists  they really cant do anything for me over the phone and i dont deem this an emergency knowing that it could be so much worse  i dont have vomiting or chronic diarrhea like with more severe chrons and my heart goes out to the people who do  

i dont know if theyll consider upping my mesalamine or maybe biologics but im not sure how many meds i have to fail before biologics become an option  i know biologics are pretty much last resort because they have lots of side effects and make you more susceptible to illness but the possibility of kidneyliver damage on mesalamine scares me too  but ive read a lot on the subreddit and heard from some mutual friends that remicade essentially made them forget they even have chrons  im just so sad i dont know what to do",2025-02-17 10:43:50,1174,hello everyone made post little ago first egdcolonoscopy result pretty unremarkable except single aphthous ulcer could seen bottom terminal ileum point awaiting result biopsy report pending prior auth capsule endoscopy biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation chronic inactive gastritis evidence erythema structuring fast forward little bit midoctober capsule endoscopy performed point everything still air far diagnosis treatment point still getting either intermittent constipation weird foulsmelling stool floated gave overwhelming sense abnormal mom tried calm told stressed never experienced bowel habit like life sometimes get horrible cramp sure worst diarrhea life always ended odd stool looked sort normal always seemed float matter feel need research everything sure sign malabsorption freaked capsule endoscopy showed structuring erythema evidence inflammation except five ulcer clustered right first one found terminal ileum diagnosed ileitis put budesonide mg seem much first retrospect think lot less symptom regretted forgot take pantoprazole day deal subsequent rebound acid awful definitely still bad day likely excessive stress december happy report gi doc feeling better could remember month np decided next best course action wean budesonide begin trial mesalamine point actually terrified switch medication seemed like pretty set fact like caught chrons early stage first actually angry denial want believe nonspecific ileitis biopsy unremarkable besides mild inflammation bloodwork completely normal calprotectin ulcer many people could walking around ulcer intestine never know nobody swallow pillcam scope gi tract regular kept spiraling continued spiral thought could mean future still definitive diagnosis begun wean budesonide think taking mg since end january effect slowly making apparent mesalamine seemed change stool something definitely consistent albeit little weird always solid problem odor smell like usual normal budesonide alone though sometimes get bm resemble stool chart always strangely easy pas return normal next day two far symptom go feel like getting lot gas really able pas feel like digesting brick sits feeling extremely bloated physically appearing stomach ache feel like liquid fire stomach small intestine gerd come back vengeance despite taking pantoprazole mg every day also feel like getting overactive bowel sound like used got budesonide mostly lie couch every evening trying find way comfortable least minute last night first time feel like forever night abdominal pain point feel lost also eager find medication regime feel like denying might receptive whatever plan get keep remission fucking sick feeling normal tired family making comment needing eat knew much fucking love try cant stand going social event watching people eat whatever want excessive amount plate toddlersized portion also cant even stomach anything drink meal feel like enough room stomach normal amount food let alone liquid fucking chore even get ounce water day feel best anything stomach get extremely hungry yet half sandwich enough fill six hour essentially eat clock venting kind anyone else boat recently diagnosed know right besides grin bear follow appointment feb th family member friend boyfriend asked call doctor medical assistant kind know standard doctor office work especially specialist really cant anything phone deem emergency knowing could much worse vomiting chronic diarrhea like severe chrons heart go people know consider upping mesalamine maybe biologics sure many med fail biologics become option know biologics pretty much last resort lot side effect make susceptible illness possibility kidneyliver damage mesalamine scare read lot heard mutual friend remicade essentially made forget even chrons sad know,Negativo,-0.8785,Negativo

ADA issue at work,"Hi everyone I am going through the process of requesting an accommodation with my employer for the first time Im finding it to be really disheartening and surprisingly contentious Was your experience similar at all

Ive been with my employer for about a decade and was diagnosed with Crohns about  years ago I have two paid  minute breaks and one  minute unpaid meal per  hour day My doctor wrote the paperwork for frequent unplanned and unlimited break time for bathroom use

Now my work has approved me for up to  additional minutes daily to be made up at the end of every shift In theory I suppose this makes sense but currently we arent required to clock out or make up time we use in the bathroom Ive pointed out that none of my coworkers have to make up time outside of scheduled breaks and how much of an invasion of privacy it feels like for everyone around me to know how much time I spent in the bathroom daily based on how late I stay

I naively thought this would be a simple and straight forward process I havent had any performance issues but I do have a new bosss boss who was questioning my break time which is what prompted me to formalize all this HR is the involved and aware of everything and I have everything in writing at this point 

Since they technically approved a request other than objecting and looking for a new job its unclear what other options I have how long did this process take for you how many different people did you have to meet with to discuss what you needed and in your opinion does this seem like the opposite of an accommodation

Could my barium study report be incomplete? The images seem to show irregularities.,"I had a barium study because of digestive symptoms and a diagnosis of nonspecific colitis based on my colonoscopy and biopsy

The radiology report states that everything is normal but I just realized it only describes the esophagus stomach and duodenumnot the intestines However when reviewing the images I noticed some irregularities in the small intestine and possibly the colon such as uneven contrast distribution and somewhat pronounced mucosal folds

Im not asking ChatGPT for a diagnosis but after analyzing the images its assessment also doesnt match the report as it highlights irregularities in the mucosa and transit that the radiologist didnt mention

My question is Could it be that my barium study report didnt include a full evaluation of my intestines Is it common for a barium study to miss mild inflammation or should I request a more detailed review of the images

Background
		Colonoscopy Inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid colon with mottling and whitish streaks
		Biopsy Acute nonspecific colitis with cryptitis and edema but no granulomas
		Barium study The official report only describes the esophagus stomach and duodenum as normal However the images seem to show irregularities in the small intestine and possibly the colon

Terminal Ileum Inflammation,"After  months of GI issues  constant and persistent diarrhea bloating gas tenesmus I finally got my colonscopy My doctor suspected colitis due to a family history but my colon looked normal  however there was inflammation in the terminal ileum However my doctor attributed that to an antibiotic rather than the possibility of Crohns  but Im a bit skeptical due to the fact that I took the antibiotic around a month before my symptoms started the symptoms have lasted  months and I already tested negative for C Diff and other infections My calprotectin was  when tested 

They took biopsies of everything including the terminal ileum I suspect my doctor is mainly looking for microscopic colitis If it is Crohns Im wondering if that would that show up on the biopsy differently than an antibiotic infection Are they able to differentiate I will likely have to wait  weeks for my biopsy results and its excruciating not knowing

My doctors have started to discuss removal of the pouch with me and Im not sure Part of me wants to get it over with and avoid future issues but part of me worries that it might mean that inflammation will reappear in another part of the gut

Update on Crohn's status and diet,"So if you have read my previous posts I was going to start on a diet that would potentially help based on my own research through nutritionorg someone did say that its probably biased because they talk about going vegan but this diet has put me in remission in  weeks and I no longer have pain in the belly but occasional itching around the perianal fistula probably because of red chilly flakes that I have noted I ate a day to  days before the episode

I have found the balance that suits me  Its a mix but its  vegetarian not vegan I have found alternate proteins that are great for the body too Below is a breakdown that suited me I thought I will share here if someone else is also trying to find the balance

 Breakfast Every single day a large bowl of fruits  apple without peeling whole pear a handful of green and red grapes a pint of blueberries and a handful mixed blackberries and raspberries 

 Snack around  organic Granola from Costco that has pumpkin and flax seeds with a pinch of cinnamon

 Lunch  Indian flatbread made with whole grain wheat flour not eating anything with only refined flour with either chickpea curry or lentil curry and ghee or any other vegetables thoroughly cooked with spices such as turmeric roasted cumin tomatoes a little bit onions ginger and garlic

 Snack steamed or air fried Edamame  atleast  oz

 Dinner again same as lunch but alongside a lot of fruits and colored vegetables such as red potatoes beetroot

What has worked for me is no milk no yogurt  if I did eat some yogurt by mistake it was hung yogurt with its water almost dried out I am eating Ghee which is clarified butter and the regular butter from Indian stores brand called Amul which is not based on cow milk but water buffalo milk 

Even though I got bored of eating the same stuff over and over again but in the last  weeks I have more energy and I want to continue doing that Lets see what happens next and I will keep everyone updated here I am not on biologics yet because I need to clear my latent TB treatment ongoing since st Jan for  months before I could start biologics If this diet keeps everything under control for me I may choose not to start biologics and keep on Azathioprine",2025-02-16 21:17:03,420,read previous post going start diet would potentially help based research nutritionorg someone say probably biased talk going vegan diet put remission week longer pain belly occasional itching around perianal fistula probably red chilly flake noted ate day day episode found balance suit mix vegetarian vegan found alternate protein great body breakdown suited thought share someone else also trying find balance breakfast every single day large bowl fruit apple without peeling whole pear handful green red grape pint blueberry handful mixed blackberry raspberry snack around organic granola costco pumpkin flax seed pinch cinnamon lunch indian flatbread made whole grain wheat flour eating anything refined flour either chickpea curry lentil curry ghee vegetable thoroughly cooked spice turmeric roasted cumin tomato little bit onion ginger garlic snack steamed air fried edamame atleast oz dinner lunch alongside lot fruit colored vegetable red potato beetroot worked milk yogurt eat yogurt mistake hung yogurt water almost dried eating ghee clarified butter regular butter indian store brand called amul based cow milk water buffalo milk even though got bored eating stuff last week energy want continue let see happens next keep everyone updated biologics yet need clear latent tb treatment ongoing since st jan month could start biologics diet keep everything control may choose start biologics keep azathioprine,Negativo,-0.1318,Positivo

Frustrated and worried,"I was diagnosed back in September  I started on Budesonide and got my first Skyrizi infusion in October Things were improving after the first infusion and after the second I was feeling great for about a month My third infusion fell right before Christmas and while we were traveling for the holidays my stomach felt pretty bad I kind of attributed this to the stress of travel along with eating a lot over the holidays and things did seem to get better again once we were home I did also get off of my Budesonide around this time so I figured my body had to adjust to that change as well 

I had my first OBI mid January No side effects from the injection itself which was great but about a week or so later my stomach started to feel crappy again I again attributed it to maybe eating something that didnt sit well but its now been about  weeks since my OBI and Im still feeling like crap Im nauseous pretty much every morning which may or may not get better over the day and overall I still feel gross Ive been trying to eat healthy and plain but it seems like nothing is really helping 

Another thing that does line up with this timeline is the fact that I started tapering to a new SSRI the day after my OBI I cross tapered from my old SSRI to the new and landed on my final dose of the new SSRI on  Since the timeline of me feeling crappy is mostly aligned with the new SSRI Im hopeful that maybe its just starting side effects of the drug and theyll get better over time  But at the same time its in the back of my mind that I did something to ruin how I was feeling or that the Skyrizi isnt going to work for me

I had an appointment with my GI last week and she said to keep on the Skyrizi and well talk again after my next OBI in March I still have yet to have a colonoscopy since starting Skyrizi so its hard to say if there is actually improvement to my inflammation My doc did mention that some people have to be on Skyrizi every  weeks instead of  so thats a possibility if things dont improve but thats a whole other element of this thats stressing me out since I dont know if my insuranceAbbvie will be difficult about approving the new frequency

First Infliximab infusion!,"I had my first infusion yesterday and Im already starting to feel better

Ive been in a flare since October  after foolishly eating some spicy potatoes they were sooo good but sooo not worth it I was on Azathioprine at the time and it just wasnt working so my doctor switched me to Infliximab

Overall the experience was good I dozed off for most of it because I woke up at am to get there extra early not doing that again and the medication they gave me was the drowsy kind

Next time Ill bring food and water I underestimated how long I was going to be there for For some of us it was hours until they started our infusions I think because we were new My mum bought a sandwich and juice from the cafeteria Best sandwich I had in my life Wish she bought another one but I went to the bathroom and back to sleep after so it was alright

They put my IV in my hand which Im not a fan of because I can FEEL everything when it first goes in and if its in too long it gets painful At least this time it was in for a few hours and not  days Once the weird feeling and the slight pain passed it was all good

I woke up this morning actually feeling well rested for once I didnt have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and no painful cramps Ive also been having sinus problems since December and even that has calmed significantly I can finally smell and breathe again

The more healthy I get the more annoyed people are at me,"Ive noticed recently since I have started to get better after a five year period of dealing with major symptoms from surgeries and also flare ups of my crohns now Im starting to get better Im dealing more and more with people being upset with me

Because Im now getting healthy or at least looking like Im well because Im managing to work more Im currently doing a remote masters degree get out of bed more and sometimes socialise when I make plans and then have to cancel people are more upset with me Before when I couldnt do anything people werent so annoyed they knew I was lacking in energy and didnt have much of an expectation But now they know I have some energy I seem to be offending people when I dont manage to use it on them

I lost a romantic relationship last year because he emotionally cheated on me I think in part due to the fact I couldnt show up for him in the way he needed I feel like Im close to losing a friendship Ive had for  years and my new friendships are starting to suffer as Im having to cancel last minute on big plans As Im focused on my Masters I get to the day before the plans weve made and can tell that if I go through with them its going to knock me out for a week and mean Im not going to have the time I need to create the work Ive got to do for my degree

I feel so ashamed when it happens and the only other alternative I can see is to not make plans with people so they never get cancelled This doesnt seem like the best option though as I want to have a social life as well as my studies

Worried and confused about IDB diagnosis CRP and bloods fine but raised 496 ug/g raised calprotectin advice needed,"Hi all 

Apologies in advance as I appreciate we cant diagnose and need to wait for results and liaise with medical

Im in UK and been referred for a urgent colonoscopy due to  ugg raised calprotectin as dr thinks I have IBD which came as a shock 

I know I shouldnt until I get the results but I hadnt even heard of IBD before this 

So over the last  months Ive had sparodic diarhea getting caught short on dog walks as I get stressed when Im away from toilet and had  instance of being on the toilet non stop like  x in the end water was coming out 

Imodium then bunged me up for a couple of weeks around Christmas time That day my diet was horrible I had redbull lots of coffee and sugar so not sure if it was related 

No blood in stool when passing but did have a tear which the dr says would explain the blood on this instance when wiping 

Fast forward to now and my stools are from the Bristol chart type  light brown colour On and off constipated but its been getting better and passing stools regularly  x 

Slight discomfort around right side and energy levels are somewhat ok maybe a little tired 

Im just confused Fit test was negative and bloods CRP are all fine 

So this raised calorotectin is the kicker for me  which is elevated 

What the fudge is going on 

Reasonable health run regular but also a fan of takeaways and coffee and chocolate  

Sounds like Im

Surgery in a few weeks and hopeful.,"Im scheduled for surgery in a few weeks after living with this disease for  years and Im hopeful for some relief My recent MRI shows I have a severe stricture at the terminal ilium blue and behind that is an area with severe dilation red  My disease has been somewhat managed for the last  years with biologics but I would still fully obstruct every few years requiring a lengthy stay at the hospital  On some days I would feel bloated and uncomfortable by the end of the day but would recover overnight after things passed I would get uncomfortable from time to time but I had more good days than bad 

What finally pushed me to seek surgery is lately Ive been having more bad days than good  I cant eat much and with that my energy level has dropped along with my weight I barely make it through a full day at work Im uncomfortable to outright painful all day and its causing me to miss time with my family 

My gastroenterologist referred me to a surgeon and my biggest concerns were I would need a large section removed and would need to have surgery again if the area scars and I get another stricture  The surgeon explained to me that basically no medication will fix my issues The stricture and dilation are structural issues that need to be physically removed His plan is to remove a section about cm long As far as needing another surgery he said  of patients need surgery within  years Not great odds but Im hopeful that if Im well managed with biologics I can prevent flare ups and scarring and can be part of the  who make it longer than  years 

Im looking forward to being able to travel spend time with my family and feeling like I should My surgeon said people like me who live with their condition convince themselves they feel ok when in reality they are just coping They have lived with the disease for so long they forget or dont know what it feels like to have a normally functioning GI tract

Just diagnosed: Haven’t found anyone else who also has Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"TLDR My diagnosis process and feeling isolated because I havent found anyone else with Chrons and CLL


August of  was my first ER trip followed by an inconclusive colonoscopy The GI doctor told me it was probably a stricture or just damage from longterm NSAID use and things would resolve on their own

I shortly after switched doctors and they scheduled a repeat upper and lower scope for a few months later In December  I ended up in the ER again Got an NG tube and the general surgeon suspected some kind of obstruction He called and got my colonoscopy moved up The GI surgeon successfully dilated a stricture at the end of my small bowel but saw no alarming sign in my large bowel They ordered a pill camera endoscopy to get a better look at my small bowel

The pill camera got stuck and I ended up in the ER again Same GI surgeon retrieved the camera It first got stuck where my stricture was based on my scans and after a few hours of IV meds and bowel prep the xray showed it moved to my cecum We were all prepped for the retrieval so we decided not to wait for it to pass

The pill camera showed moderate to severe Chrons in my small bowel Its crazy to me that it took more than  months to figure it out but I know others suffer for years Im on my th week of prednisone tapering for  more weeks

My doctor wanted me to start skyrizi but its not covered so she switched to Stelara After  weeks my insurance came back and said I needed to try Entyvio first I have Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia so being on a biologic that also lowers immune system response is a little scary Ive searched in both of my CLL support groups and havent come across anyone else with both diseases Feels a little isolating",2025-03-14 17:55:29,328,tldr diagnosis process feeling isolated found anyone else chrons cll august first er trip followed inconclusive colonoscopy gi doctor told probably stricture damage longterm nsaid use thing would resolve shortly switched doctor scheduled repeat upper lower scope month later december ended er got ng tube general surgeon suspected kind obstruction called got colonoscopy moved gi surgeon successfully dilated stricture end small bowel saw alarming sign large bowel ordered pill camera endoscopy get better small bowel pill camera got stuck ended er gi surgeon retrieved camera first got stuck stricture based scan hour iv med bowel prep xray showed moved cecum prepped retrieval decided wait pas pill camera showed moderate severe chrons small bowel took month figure know others suffer year th week prednisone tapering week doctor wanted start skyrizi covered switched stelara week insurance came back said needed try entyvio first chronic lymphocytic leukemia biologic also lower immune system response little scary searched cll support group come across anyone else disease feel little isolating,Negativo,-0.9419,Negativo

IBD Management App - Would this be useful to you or not?,"Hi everyone

Just a quick introduction first My name is Sai i am  years old and i have Ulcerative Colitis for the last  years Last year and a half was quite horrible as i had consistent flareups lost my job because of it and only just recently started to get better with new medication and visits to hospital

Following the struggle i have thought about making an Web and Phone  iOSAndroid based app for IBD management for each specific Ulcer condition Crohns and so on

I have made some research and noticed that there are a few similar apps around but they dont bring full functionality that could be useful for people like us

Im working on the app as we speak it will act as a management tool of your

 Appointments  
 Medication  
 Symptoms  
 Food diery and Food restrictions  
 Resources  for indepth information regarding these conditions help pages and much more

This is the base that im working on right now this tool would be used to extensively track your symptoms your food consumption and what makes your stommach go worse or even give you a flare up

You would have everything in one place which i personally struggle to keep reminding myself to note down what i ate or what made my stomach worse my medication appointments and so on

I have a lot of future features already in my mind  that would be really useful to implement like

 Food analytics  A indepth statistics on which foods make your health worse which ones make it better for better diet management  
 IBDFriendly Meal Planning  Personalized food library of safe and trigger foods  
 Medication effectiveness  to keep your regular medicine in check and see if its still useful  
 Compare symptoms across different treatment periods  
Stress Management Tools  Personalized stress reduction recommendations  
 Travel Companion  Restroom finder map integration  Cant stress enough how much this would help  
 Export  Sharing Features  Use for when you go to hospital appointments to assist further analysis  
 Community  Forum like area where people can talk about the condition share useful tips and tricks and just have a good time sharing their experiences

And many more ideas

As for App type  App would be entirely free for the core functions NO ADS as well I hate them and i would instead have happy people using the app instead of having to deal with ads for extra few bucks

I would have to monetize the app in some way to keep up the hostingbackend fees and also be able to further develop the app for better user and my own experience so i was thinking about a Premium features that you could get by paying a small subscription fee or one time payment  I havent decided yet about the how would i monetize the app BUT CORE FEATURES WILL ALWAYS STAY FREE AND AD FREE

  
Please let me know your thoughts if you would use it personally and any suggestions are welcome As you might see one or few of them appear when the App is finished  thank you",2025-03-14 15:06:43,538,hi everyone quick introduction first name sai year old ulcerative colitis last year last year half quite horrible consistent flareups lost job recently started get better new medication visit hospital following struggle thought making web phone iosandroid based app ibd management specific ulcer condition crohn made research noticed similar apps around bring full functionality could useful people like u working app speak act management tool appointment medication symptom food diery food restriction resource indepth information regarding condition help page much base working right tool would used extensively symptom food consumption make stommach go worse even give flare would everything one place personally struggle keep reminding note ate made stomach worse medication appointment lot future feature already mind would really useful implement like food analytics indepth statistic food make health worse one make better better diet management ibdfriendly meal planning personalized food library safe trigger food medication effectiveness keep regular medicine check see still useful compare symptom across different treatment period stress management tool personalized stress reduction recommendation travel companion restroom finder map integration cant stress enough much would help export sharing feature use go hospital appointment assist analysis community forum like area people talk condition share useful tip trick good time sharing experience many idea app type app would entirely free core function ad hate would instead happy people using app instead deal ad extra buck would monetize app way keep hostingbackend fee also able develop app better user experience thinking premium feature could get paying small subscription fee one time payment decided yet would monetize app core feature always stay free ad free please let know thought would use personally suggestion welcome might see one appear app finished thank,Positivo,0.9957,Neutro

Has anybody stopped infliximab infusions of their own accord and what was the result?,"Ive been recieving infliximab infusions since  when the specialist persuaded me to take the medical salvage route instead of surgery to remove my large intestine
I wish Id have never taken his advice because Ive never been the same and over the past  years Ive been getting awful pain on my left side whenever I open my bowels the pain is so bad Ive passed out more times than I care to count
Ive been receiving pain meds from my GP and they do help but I feel that just mask the issues i have with my left side

I recently had a colonoscopy and it came back without any reason to why Im getting so much pain on my left side When I had the colonoscopy I was in agony on my left side as soon as they was in that area so there is something going on but Im left without an answer

Back to my original question has anyone stopped infliximab treatment
I want to know because Im at a point with my GP because if they cant say why Im getting the pain hes going to stop the pain medication which will leave me to suffer alone Ive asked several times over the past  years for my intestine removing and for an illesostomy so I dont have the pain Im having but they keep refusing due to the infliximab apparently doing such a good job

How long did it take you to get used to self-injecting your meds?,"Hi fellow crohnies I started on Stelara two months ago with an infusion dose done in the clinic then decided to switch to home injections I did my first one last night and while I am proud I did pretty well overall it was really emotionally taxing 

I did ok with the initial poke and start of the injection but it took way longer than I was expecting to slowly dispense I then held my breath while I was focusing so hard not on purpose and almost passed out by the time I got to the end I had to lay down and then cried about feeling weak and the realization that this is going to be the new normal for the rest of my life 

Overall I think I did as well as I could have for the first dose but please tell me how long did it take you to feel comfortable with self injecting your meds Any tips for me Im grateful Im only supposed to do Stelara every  weeks but it also means I dont get a ton of practice Knowing how expensive they are and how long it took me to get approval and figure out specialty shipping also makes me build it up a ton and afraid to mess it up adding pressure to everything

Trying to get a diagnosis since October.,"Ive been having a lot of stomach problems for about a year now though a lot of symptoms really ramped up consistently in October Feels like I have most of the tell tale signs with the exception of blood in the stool My fecal calprotectin was  and I finally got to get a colonoscopy I just got the results from that and here were the findings 

Sections show ileal mucosa with scattered lamina propria neutrophils foci of cryptitis and surface erosions No granulomata are identified Mildly active ileitis with surface erosions The histologic findings are etiologically nonspecific and in isolation are not sufficient for a histologic diagnosis of Crohns disease however the possibility remains in the differential diagnosis

So as far as I can tell this means its still up in the air My GI is on vacation until April and thats when I can discuss the results with him 

Is there anything I can do or take in the meantime to help the symptoms I feel like theyll order more tests which means more waiting which means Im still stuck at home near a toilet So any tips that could help me through the waiting would be really helpful

What a journey. 🤪,"This roller coaster of a disease called Crohns is one Id like to get off of I dont even like real roller coasters

Because sooo many issues cross over or have the same symptoms things are getting overlooked and now its getting serious

"Currently suffering with ""mild"" Crohn's, hospital want me to up my infliximab dose along with Azathioprine. I am very reluctant because of the risks involved. Can anyone give me some advice please?","Hi everyone  I would really appreciate any advice anyone can give me on my current situation

I am  male from the UK I was diagnosed with Crohns disease back in  when I presented to my GP with a perianal abscess where ofc it had to be drained and the wound deroofed as they call it Since then I have been under both a Colorectal and IBD consultant at my local hospital who have been monitoring me regularly

About  REUAs  MRIs  blood tests  colonoscopys and so far  infliximab infusions later which have done nothing in terms of treatment the IBD consultant has come to the conclusion that he wants to double my dose of Infliximab for my next infusion check the levels of infliximab in my blood and then base future dosing on this level Apparently this is to ensure that Im getting enough infliximab and that my body is continuing to absorb it as well as they would like not forming antibodies They said this is common practice once I am established on Infliximab

Alongside this they also talked to me about adding in a drug called Azathioprine This is a tablet medication that works as an immunomodulator This means it dampens down your immune system They said this drug in itself is a treatment for IBD  working by reducing my immune system to treat the overactivity of my immune system that occurs in IBD They said the reasons that they favour using this alongside infliximab in particular is that it helps to preserve the life of a patients infliximab treatment by hopefully stopping my body from rejecting the drug building antibodies in future So for me this does mean I would be doubly immunosuppressed and they mentioned the risks of this including an increased risk of certain types of cancer They did mention that they have to weigh up these risks against the risks of losing the option of Infliximab in future 

Unfortunately I havent taken too well to this news as both doubling the dosage of infliximab and starting on this new drug alongside doesnt exactly appeal to me because of course it would mean almost basically killing off my immune system and exposing me to certain types of cancer at the cost of maybe treating my Crohns And even if my Crohns got better on this medication whos to say being on this medication wouldnt present me with a whole barrage of other problems Such as being constantly fluridden all the time best case scenario Worst case scenario I get stage  cancer but hey thats not the IBD teams problem right

Ive tried to make the argument that besides suffering with some bowel movements on the odd occasion like severe constipation thanks to  strictures that were found in my lower rectum potentially caused by Crohns hence the diagnoses I feel like I live a relatively normal life I have a fulltime job a partner and an adequate social life to complement it all and this was before I even started the infliximab infusions I really dont want to sacrifice that all at the risk of going on some medication that could change all of that On the other side their argument is that while I am okay right now that could also change and in fact the stricturing in my bowel could get even worse to the point where surgery would be needed and I would end up with a stoma 

So I really dont know what to do Im sure some people here might judge my own judgement skills here but this feels like one of the hardest decisions Ive ever had to make My choices feel like Im choosing between have a piss poor quality of life or have a fucking dogshit of quality of life

But I would like to know everyone elses thoughts Has anyone else experienced being on this medication and come out of it in a more positive light Did you decline it and find it turned out better for you 

TLDR I am not happy with the medication plan the hospital want to put me on because of the high cancer risks involved and basically killing off my immune system I feel like I live a relatively normal life right now I dont want to change that Being in and out of hospital constantly the past  months or so has become a complete chore and a burden to me more than anything and I genuinely dont think I should keep going unless I thought that my Crohns condition could change instantly and they dont seem to know whether it will or not",2025-03-13 18:21:06,784,hi everyone would really appreciate advice anyone give current situation male uk diagnosed crohn disease back presented gp perianal abscess ofc drained wound deroofed call since colorectal ibd consultant local hospital monitoring regularly reuas mri blood test colonoscopy far infliximab infusion later done nothing term treatment ibd consultant come conclusion want double dose infliximab next infusion check level infliximab blood base future dosing level apparently ensure getting enough infliximab body continuing absorb would like forming antibody said common practice established infliximab alongside also talked adding drug called azathioprine tablet medication work immunomodulator mean dampens immune system said drug treatment ibd working reducing immune system treat overactivity immune system occurs ibd said reason favour using alongside infliximab particular help preserve life patient infliximab treatment hopefully stopping body rejecting drug building antibody future mean would doubly immunosuppressed mentioned risk including increased risk certain type cancer mention weigh risk risk losing option infliximab future unfortunately taken news doubling dosage infliximab starting new drug alongside exactly appeal course would mean almost basically killing immune system exposing certain type cancer cost maybe treating crohn even crohn got better medication say medication present whole barrage problem constantly fluridden time best case scenario worst case scenario get stage cancer hey thats ibd team problem right tried make argument besides suffering bowel movement odd occasion like severe constipation thanks stricture found lower rectum potentially caused crohn hence diagnosis feel like live relatively normal life fulltime job partner adequate social life complement even started infliximab infusion really want sacrifice risk going medication could change side argument okay right could also change fact stricturing bowel could get even worse point surgery would needed would end stoma really know sure people might judge judgement skill feel like one hardest decision ever make choice feel like choosing piss poor quality life fucking dogshit quality life would like know everyone elses thought anyone else experienced medication come positive light decline find turned better tldr happy medication plan hospital want put high cancer risk involved basically killing immune system feel like live relatively normal life right want change hospital constantly past month become complete chore burden anything genuinely think keep going unless thought crohn condition could change instantly seem know whether,Negativo,-0.9778,Neutro

Constant rectum or sigmoid colon pain,"Hi all

Im currently not in a flare according to the most recent out dated results scopes in august  and calprotectin increased from  to  in nov  Due to do bloods and calprotectin again next month 

For the last  plus months Ive had constant pain behind my bladder in the rectum or sigmoid colon Ive tried to explain this to my GI of  years but she just thinks it is from other things such as food IBS bladder issues However it is always much worse when I need to go to the loo particularly afterwards and I do have constant fissures
I tend to be more constipated as my general stomach hurts so much so I take codeine but even with constipation I go to the bathroom  or so times a day just as pebbles I try to balance this with stool softeners which also can have me on the bathroom  times a day with diarrhea And then the wiping makes me bleed
Occasionally the constipation has blood with it on the toilet paper 

My last colonoscopy included comments that lax rectal mucosa was present in the distal rectum Would this help explain this constant pain Does anyone else have any experienceidea with what the heck could be going on 

Even after a  year relationship with my GI Im tempted to get another opinion as Im now only being treated with mesalazine after reaching remission and coming off azathioprine due to constant infections and being hospitalised My GI is not keen to put me on anything else until my calprotectin reaches minimum  Im in Australia and they have to prove that Azathioprine hasnt worked and you have bleeding before being allowed to put you on biologics this is what she has told me  because the government subsidises them and it costs the government a lot of money

I should mention that last year I was hospitalised in a flare with calprotectin near  but was all good after a month on prednisone My GI refused to believe it was crohns as it was in the large intestines and my crohns in normally only at the ileum Shes adamant it was food poisoning Yet no bacteria were present in my samples

Help - awaiting diagnosis #uk,"Hey Reddit 

Im a yr old male based in the UK and unable to afford private healthcare to fast track this any appointments to get some answers Does the below sound like I could be living with Crohns or on a path towards that diagnosis

I should add that I have since found out last couple of weeks a half sibling older than me suffers from Crohns and none of their other siblings  same mum have Crohns

Back in August  while training and carb loading for a half marathon I noticed a change in bowel habits Initially I put it down to training and the fact the last time I carb loaded was  pre COVID

Half marathon was early September and I dropped off the carb loading pretty much straight aftee Sadly my symptoms didnt subside and at end of September I managed to see a GP face to face 

I had some blood and fecal tests done my FIT test came back positive and I was seen under the WW pathway for a colonoscopy 

Colonoscopy happened mid October and  biopsies were taken of which  came back with the following on the report
 Mildly patchy mucin depreciation  Yes acute inflammatory cell infiltrate  moderate chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate  moderate distribution of inflammation  patchy Nancy histological index of  

I was discharged from the WW pathway back in November after the above as there was no signs of the C word 

However Ive been left in limbo with waiting for the Gastroenterology team to get back to me with a standard appointment

Since then I have been back to my GP once already because of the additional following symptoms

Tiredness out of nowhere 
Food not digesting properly
More mucas in stools and present every bowel movement
Lack of energy 
Some more small blot clots in stools

Had another repeat round of blood tests and they are marked as normal yet my white cell count doubled between September and end of January but remained just under the normal UK average to consider further investigation

Fistula vs Cyst. Is it possible to differentiate?,"Hello everyone I have a huge doubt about what I really have whether it is a fistula or a perianal cyst although only an imaging test can confirm I wanted to know if any of you had the same symptoms and were identified as having a fistula

I have had something under my skin since  it is palpable like an oval ball which grows from time to time and then bursts However what differentiates it from a fistula at least from what I have read is that it does not have a visible external opening and there is no daily drainage of pus only when it bursts In addition the opening formed to expel the pus heals after about two days and remains closed

I see that many people who have a fistula feel symptoms in a nonacute phase of the abscess such as pain bleeding etc I do not have any of these

My family has problems with cysts I myself have some in the armpit region And strangely enough this is the second time that at the same time as it grows in the armpit it grows in my buttocks Even the way the wound looks after it bursts is the same it burns the same when you take a shower for example etc

It also usually creates a new abscess when I sit for hours and hours without rest so I assume it is due to the pressure exerted rather than a bacterial infection although in cases of abscess I am always prescribed antibiotics

I had a colonoscopy  months ago which did not identify anything in the anal glands I am afraid it is a fistula from the postoperative period",2025-03-12 15:42:14,285,hello everyone huge doubt really whether fistula perianal cyst although imaging test confirm wanted know symptom identified fistula something skin since palpable like oval ball grows time time burst however differentiates fistula least read visible external opening daily drainage pu burst addition opening formed expel pu heals two day remains closed see many people fistula feel symptom nonacute phase abscess pain bleeding etc family problem cyst armpit region strangely enough second time time grows armpit grows buttock even way wound burst burn take shower example etc also usually creates new abscess sit hour hour without rest assume due pressure exerted rather bacterial infection although case abscess always prescribed antibiotic colonoscopy month ago identify anything anal gland afraid fistula postoperative period,Negativo,-0.8779,Negativo

"insurance stopped covering Humira, offered Hadlima - but apparently only the citrate version?","Hi all

  
I have been taking Humira autoinjector pen for Chrons and hidradentritis supprativa for several years now i have had almost no issues January this year I received a letter that my insurance no longer covers Humira my doctor said they would submit a prior authorization for me to try and get it approved After a couple weeks that was denied saying I had to try Hadlima for six months and only if I was allergicit had horrible complications etc they would consider switching me back

I had a lot of concerns about the copay since my deductible is very high and the Humira reimbursement program basically eliminated that for me but I could manage that

But today I got a letter in the mail DENYING my doctors prior authorization request for Hadlima MGmL Apparently they would only allow me to try Hadlima MGmL and THEN after  months they would consider letting me switch to a different medication

i had no idea why they would care about the amount of liquid in the dose so I looked it up a bit and it seems that possibly the Hadlima mL is not citrate free like the mL or like Humira i have heard that Humira was painful before they got rid of the citrate and read similar things about Hadlima

  
I dont really know what I am asking here Im just a bit scared I already am frequently a few days late for my Humira dose because I hate doing the shots and if pain is involved it will surely be worse does anyone have any experience with specifically Hadlima MGmL does it hurt worse than Humira

 also does anyone know if there is a reimbursement program or something similar for Hadlima

 or if anyone has any other advice it would be greatly appreciated

"Are there any risks or downsides to Entyvio?

She had me try budesonide last SpringSummer and the side effects were so bad I thought I was dying mostly extreme fatiguebrain fog blurry vision tunnel vision feeling weak sometimes chest tightness and heart palpitations and a few other I dont remember and then she put me on mesalamine after my last colonoscopy a few months ago but that caused a lot of weird side effects too brain fog that felt more like I was stoned as opposed to the regular tirednesslack of concentration I normally have with brain fog abdominal pain excess gas and I started getting a weird reddishpurple rash on my arm that looked like a bruise but didnt hurt when I pressed on it and that went away a few days after I stopped taking the mesalamine Im also a little worried since I read PML is a potential risk with Entyvio it seems like it was just a one off case during the clinical trials but with my luck something like that would happen Im more worried about the side effects in general since Im guessing an infusion based medicine would hit me harder if I do have a bad reaction to it  

Ive posted a few times before but my GI suspects that I have Crohns disease because I have inflammation in my colon around my ileum but my biopsies from both colonoscopies Ive had came back negative and I still think it could be something else I dont know if it could be some sort of infection like SIFOcandida or a parasite or something like H Pylori but a lot of my symptoms dont line up too much with Crohns and a lot of my trigger foods dont seem to either I know Crohns varies a lot and I still think it could be Crohns but this whole things been so confusing and stressful especially since I dont have a confirmed diagnosis and my GI doesnt want to do any more testing to rule out any other possibilities after the two colonoscopies either My new primary care wants to do more testing and shes sending me to a functional medicine doctor too I met with his CNP and she said hes gonna do more testing to check for infectionsother possibilities but my primary care also wants me to work in conjunction with my GI who doesnt seem to be doing much to help

Fistula healing with Remicade,"I got diagnosed with crohns after having a small abscess at the end of  The abscess actually burst itself and healed relatively quickly but on MRI there was evidence of a complex branching fistula 

I was lucky enough to start Remicade relatively quickly and my levels are now therapeutic and I have absolutely no fistula symptoms anymore My CRS couldnt even really find the opening on their exam 

My follow up MRI showed some healing of the fistula one of the branches is gone but the main part is still there My CRS still wants me to do an EUA with probably seton placement She told me it would be there with an indefinite timeline 

The more I research setons the more I am horrified I cannot believe anyone would have a good quality of life with it in I have a very active lifestyle and have to drive really long distances for work  my job requires me to sit and I feel the seton would dramatically disrupt my life I know its technically the right thing to do but I cant live with the thought that my quality of life is about to plummet dramatically next week after my procedure When I explained these concerns to my surgeon the only answer I got was that you can still walk and do light exercise and that youll have to do a lot of cleanup every day  

I feel unprepared for this huge life shift Ive had to request accommodations at work that dont seem possible I have concerns about intimacy with my partner Im so fucking frustrated and anxious about this procedure

Im wondering if anyone has been in this position Has anyone put off the seton and achieved healing with Remicade alone All the studies Ive read point towards lower likelihood of this and its really disheartening",2025-03-11 16:49:18,310,got diagnosed crohn small abscess end abscess actually burst healed relatively quickly mri evidence complex branching fistula lucky enough start remicade relatively quickly level therapeutic absolutely fistula symptom anymore cr even really find opening exam follow mri showed healing fistula one branch gone main part still cr still want eua probably seton placement told would indefinite timeline research seton horrified cannot believe anyone would good quality life active lifestyle drive really long distance work job requires sit feel seton would dramatically disrupt life know technically right thing cant live thought quality life plummet dramatically next week procedure explained concern surgeon answer got still walk light exercise lot cleanup every day feel unprepared huge life shift request accommodation work seem possible concern intimacy partner fucking frustrated anxious procedure wondering anyone position anyone put seton achieved healing remicade alone study read point towards lower likelihood really disheartening,Negativo,-0.9047,Negativo

Calprotectin Discovery,"Hey guys maybe this post can help someone

Ever since I was diagnosed my calpro levels have been off the chart and it took years to bring them back to normal levels around  thanks to medication

I have a great doc and he tests my calpro levels every  month and it has been consistent for the past  years at ish

For some unrelated disease I was prescribed Berberine at a dose of mg per day which didnt do the job well
This is my th month taking it and  month ago my calpro level went to  and last week during my routine test it went down to 

I didnt post the first time thinking it was a fluke or a random luck test but now i strongly believe that Berberine helped lower my levels I dont take anything else besides the regular vit DironB which i have been taking for years

The million dollar question is
Did Berberine lower my inflammation or it just lowered the calpro number artificially but the inflammation level is still there as if im at ish level

I guess Ill know in  month during my scope appointment
I read very few studies linking Berberine to a small decrease in inflammation in UC patients but nothing for us

Its my throwaway account

Im a woman in my early s and Ive been having a Crohns for almost  years now First  years were absolutely miserable for me constant flareup nothing helped

Unfortunately about one month after Id started Infliximab I got eczema And its untreatable for any topical creams corticosteroid creams light therapy and so on Dermatologists told me that theyve tried everything except of oral steroid medications

My dermatologist suggested me to switch to Rinvoq as its used both for Crohns and for eczema My gastroenterologist said preliminary yes we can switch you

But Im scared Im scared so much  Im afraid that my Crohns may come back that Rinvoq wont work And I dont want to live with it again People in this subreddit I guess fully understand I read about possible side effects of Rinvoq and Im scared of constant herpes horrible cyclic acne constant fatigue Im literally almost paralyzed with a scare

Is any one in same boat?,"I an  year old initially went to my doctor for calf pain and my PCP ran some tests which revealed that I was prediabetic Over the past year Ive also experienced occasional constipation and once or twice noticed a few drops of blood in my stool When my PCP repeated the tests the results showed that I was anemic and positive for H pylori infection I underwent triple antibiotic therapy for H pylori and a followup breath test confirmed that the infection was gone However my iron levels remained low so my doctor recommended an endoscopy and colonoscopy

The results showed an ulcer in my terminal ileum and a perianal fistula raising concerns about possible Crohns disease To make things more complicated I tested positive for H pylori again and my doctor now wants to start quadruple therapy Im struggling to understand whether this is truly Crohns or if something else could be causing these issues

Shortness of breath from Skyrizi?,"Hi my fellow travelers

Has anyone had issues with Skyrizi causing shortness of breath and worsening brain fog I know folks have experienced worsening fatigue and joint pain

Since a few weeks after my third infusion and continuing after my first home injection a week ago I have been experiencing shortness of breath and worsening fatigue and brain fog 
My doctor had me do a chest xray and echocardiogram both of which are clean and clear Tomorrow Im going for a CT scan  

The shortness of breath is just there all of the time and not caused by exertion And perhaps getting less oxygen is contributing to the fatigue and brain fog

I initially thought it was likely from low iron but I had my levels tested and they were all normal plus I got a routine iron infusion about a week and a half ago 

So then I tested thyroid levels and T and T are normal  and TSH is slightly low but my PCP didnt think it was enough to create the symptoms Im having 

I tend to be sensitive and get all kinds of side effects so was just curious to see if anyone else on Skyrizi had experienced shortness of breath Im also on budesonide but have been on and off over the year and its never been a problem  

Its so frustrating and demoralizing because I keep hoping the next thing is going to help me feel better and now I feel worse and more incapacitated than ever

Anyone else get passed from one resource to another for over a month and miss their infusion because of it?,"Im writing this post for my partner F who was diagnosed with severe Crohns back in late early  She only just started her loading dose of Remicade a couple of months ago after trying Entyvio for nearly a year and has been finally improving But then her insurance changed and her job was not offering accommodations for the hr monthly infusion appointments beyond telling her she needs to use PTO for those appointments as she needs hrs per week shes hourly and cannot make up that time easily due to her schedule needing to be ampm Luckily though she is hybrid so she thought to switch the home infusions

When she planned to switch to home infusions at a place called NuFactor her infusion scheduler said she would send the information over there which was  weeks prior to her scheduled infusion appointment Long story short someone dropped the ball in communication there despite her being told that her case was being handled and it turned out NuFactor claimed they did not have the information needed and did not have the authorization yet from her insurance This process alone took about two weeks with her being relatively on top of checking in Then when she started really twisting arms she found out her new insurance would not even cover Remicade only inflectra

At that point she was over a week overdue for her infusion with only budesonide to hold her over and started becoming very symptomatic getting long bouts of stabbing gas pains and nausea to where she barely wanted to eat and had lost  lbs She immediately tried to set up an urgent appointment with CVS specialty whom she was told carried the drug but they gave her no callback number just said they would handle it and call her when ready and never called last week Today she found out CVS specialty pharmacy had not even started on the insurance authorization process they said they would last week

So today I took half a day off of work for us each to make probably  calls each within the span of  hours and finally with tears was able to get her at least an appt with her doctor and just restart the whole process with ANOTHER infusion place that should work out

tldr Have any of yall been put through the doctors office not communicating with insurance who is not communicating with infusion providers limbo It is so extremely frustrating that they can just miscommunicate and let things sit to a point where my partner is crying in pain without clear reprieve Does anyone have any tips for this sort of situation in the future I ask because I am certain it will happen again

Road to Diagnosis,"I scoured every forum including this one during my first real flare and feel the need to pay it forward with my own diagnosis story in case even one person finds it helpful 

TLDR Liquid diarrhea urgency high fever weight loss fatigue mouth ulcers psoriasis Diagnosed with mild Crohns Budesonide as bridge to biologic Advocate for yourself push for the colonoscopy 

In early October  I had a rare weekend to myself that I was looking forward to as being equally productive and relaxed Instead liquid diarrhea hit Saturday morning followed by high fever and chills By am on Monday morning I had called my mom at least five times to come pick up my toddler because I was not okay Liquid diarrhea extreme chills followed by  fever zero energy Fever and chills returned as soon as the Tylenol wore off diarrhea was consistent I ate nothing and lost lbs and mostly laid in bed unable to sleep or entertain myself with books or TV These symptoms persisted for almost the entire month of October with little to no reprieve 

I had one GP visit two urgent care visits two ER visits one hospitalization one Infectious Disease visit one Gastroenterologist visit after symptoms abated due to scheduling Of note the GI during my hospitalization swore up and down that I had a GI bug that would resolve after a few weeks Infectious Disease said that it looked autoimmune and that I should push for a colonoscopy Urgent Care  said that they couldnt believe I was released from the hospital GI recommended against a colonoscopy because Im not in the standard age range  for IBD diagnosis and because my calpro range was undetectable I also have a closeish family member who is a retired GI Oncologist heavily recommending a colonoscopy 

I was diagnosed with mild Crohns Disease after colonoscopy and put on a Budesonide bridge before starting a biologic thats appropriate for both Crohns and Psoriasis 

In hindsight I believe that I had several minor flares before October  which I attributed to food poisoning Norovirus and Hand Foot and Mouth mouth ulcers only Illnesses are not uncommon due to having a toddler though I also believed  during it all that I was getting sick more than normal because my immune system was severely weakened because I had two pregnancies and Csections very close together plus the stress of PTSD from losing our first child soon after birth in the NICU 

I feel very lucky that I had multiple doctors urging me to get a colonoscopy because it helped me to push GI for the procedure against their advice 

In my view the moral of the entire story is best summarized by the Infectious Disease doctor who I met with for less than twenty minutes Gastroenterologists are very procedural doctors They see a patient who is not in the standard age range for onset does not have the standard symptoms or abdominal pain and seemingly recovers without  intervention The patient has recovered and doesnt need a GI anymore As an aside He was the most helpful doctor that I initially saw because he validated both my symptoms and feelings  screenshot included

How do people deal with insurance in the US with crohns,"Ive been trying to piece my life back together and want to move forward but it feels like my crohns are chains that continue to appear anytime I try to Ive been racking my head trying to figure out a way that makes sense but Im so scared of losing my situation if I mess up 



Im  and i was diagnosed with crohns  years ago and only recently have been cleared for no signs of inflammation after colonoscopy on humira It took a long time of pain and fighting back and forth with insurance with denials to get to this point Im on medicaidmedical and receiving treatment from a crohns specialist within UCLA Normally I wouldnt even be able to receive care from a GI doctor within this network from most insurance so Im grateful for it The problem is that I really need to be able to start earning and that would mean losing medical Ive messed up my life even before my diagnosis so I only have a general bachelors degree for business and basically  work experience up until now



I would most likely have to go find insurance on the ACA marketplace but all these plans are extremely expensive in the sense that the deductiblemax out of pocket is in the k range which I would hit every year and most likely wouldnt be able to afford I would most likely have to switch to an alternative biosimilar to humira where the payment assistance program would be able to cover maybe  doses at most and I would have to pay for the rest to hit max OOP per year I would also lose my doctor because UCLA isnt in network with most insurances and I would have to most likely go through the entire preauthorization process again Just thinking about how many things would go wrong is beyond stressful and thats not even counting trying to find a job would be like Do I just have to accept that theres no good option and to just start over again

I Don’t Know Which Medication is Working,"Hi everyone I guess this post is just a bit of a rant I was diagnosed in September  and Ive only technically achieved remission once since then and it was for about two months I started Remicade in October  but I failed this biologic and I had to wait almost  months to switch to Humira due to insurance and test results I finally started Humira at the beginning January and I had a colonoscopy last month 

I started Prednisone mg at the same time I started Humira and I didnt begin to feel relief until  weeks after I started both which I thought was odd because Prednisone usually returns me to normal in a week I took a five day course back in November and it got me back to normal for about a week Anyway my symptoms slowly began to return to normal and could finally go more than three hours without running to the toilet I forgot what it was like to feel healthy again and I have been happy for the past month or so 

I started the Prednisone taper about a month ago I still had a little bit of blood in my stool but my doctor removed a huge polyp during my colonoscopy so I eventually got to the point where there was no visible bleeding even during this taper I have my next Humira dose tomorrow and I noticed that I began to feel kind of sick on Thursday Ive had stomach pain for the past few days and then I had diarrhea earlier today Im down to mg Prednisone and about to go to mg Im worried that my symptoms are returning as a result of the taper but theres also a possibility my body just needs my next injection 

I cant imagine having to stay on Prednisone any longer Ive been on it  times in the last two years two of which were mg for  months and it has completely devastated my body I have acne scars that wont fade and stretch marks and I lost half my hair I even have a mustache which mostly fades after Ive been off of it for a couple months and people have made hurtful comments on my appearance I also have horrible mental side effects and I feel so depressed right now I was starting to have a hopeful outlook on this disease but it feels like remission is just slipping away I have a GI appointment in two weeks so hopefully that will help but Im just going to take my Humira tomorrow and hope for the best Thank you for listening to my rant",2025-03-09 16:29:02,448,hi everyone guess post bit rant diagnosed september technically achieved remission since two month started remicade october failed biologic wait almost month switch humira due insurance test result finally started humira beginning january colonoscopy last month started prednisone mg time started humira begin feel relief week started thought odd prednisone usually return normal week took five day course back november got back normal week anyway symptom slowly began return normal could finally go three hour without running toilet forgot like feel healthy happy past month started prednisone taper month ago still little bit blood stool doctor removed huge polyp colonoscopy eventually got point visible bleeding even taper next humira dose tomorrow noticed began feel kind sick thursday stomach pain past day diarrhea earlier today mg prednisone go mg worried symptom returning result taper also possibility body need next injection cant imagine stay prednisone longer time last two year two mg month completely devastated body acne scar fade stretch mark lost half hair even mustache mostly fade couple month people made hurtful comment appearance also horrible mental side effect feel depressed right starting hopeful outlook disease feel like remission slipping away gi appointment two week hopefully help going take humira tomorrow hope best thank listening rant,Negativo,-0.5274,Negativo

Either I healed crohns or never had it,"About nine months ago I had a brutal bout of vomiting and diarrhea that lasted for eight hours I honestly thought Id have to go to the hospital

After that I felt nauseous almost constantly for nine months I also had acid reflux and my esophagus was in painsometimes so bad that even talking hurt I was put on acid blockers and completely cut out acidic foods and drinks like carbonated beverages coffee and fatty foods that stimulate stomach acid production

My symptoms only improved very slowly over the course of months It felt like the nightmare would never end

A few weeks ago life finally started to feel somewhat livable again Before that I had basically been unable to work for nine months Fortunately since I can work from home and can mostly take it easy I somehow managed to get through it without losing my job

I was almost in the clear until I started adding some different food and beverages Then after a few days things got bad again

Out of nowhere I felt nauseous againwithout smoking drinking or eating anything unhealthy that day

I thought This cant be happening Will this ever end

I felt absolutely sick to my stomach and just wanted to throw up to get some relief I started shaking my body to make my stomach acid slosh around hoping to force myself to vomit And then I did

What I saw was shocking whole green beans staring back at me I thought Huh they still look freshly picked That probably means my stomach isnt digesting them properly

Thats when I learned through ChatGPT that eating too fast can increase stomach acid production by up to  Saliva helps the stomach by reducing its workload and even killing bacteria

I used to inhale a kebap in five to ten minutes At the table I was always the first one done eating Apparently no one ever taught me to eat slowly

A few days ago I started consciously eating slowerchewing more until my food was nothing but salivasoaked mush On top of that I started taking PPIs again which previously hadnt been effective even at high doses over long periods

Within just a few days my symptoms started healing at turbo speed Now theyre almost completely gone and my stomach feels better than ever I used to get car sick as a passenger all the timeI cant imagine that happening anymore And heres where it gets even crazier

Ive had Crohns disease for about six yearsa chronic inflammation of the intestines My symptoms were diarrhea frequent trips to the bathroom bloating and occasional constipation

Back then a colonoscopy showed that only a tiny part of my terminal ileitis I believe that was it was slightly inflamed I was given corticosteroid granules to swallow but they didnt help My doctor took my poop and did a blood test but my inflammation markers werent concerning Since I could live with my symptoms somewhat normally we just left it at that

Then last year I suddenly developed an anal fistulaa complication of Crohns disease I had to have surgery to remove it

After that I looked for a Crohns specialist in my city since I moved and hadnt had one there yet We did another colonoscopy and my doctor was shocked My entire intestine was inflamed and full of erosions

He asked me how I was even able to workapparently I didnt look sick at all In my head I just thought If only he knew But I didnt say anything Now the turnaround

Since I started eating my food slowly my Crohns symptoms have completely disappeared My restroom visits are just once daily and my poop is like its supposed to be so solid that you dont even have to wipe your butt Once it even was so massive it slipped into the toilet I didnt even have to flush

Next week I have an appointment to start longterm infusion therapy for Crohns but Ill probably cancel it if my symptoms dont come back

Even my fatigue lack of motivation ADHD and allergy symptoms seem dramatically reduced Though I might be getting ahead of myself hereIll have to wait and see Im also doing desensitization therapy for my dust mite allergy and had my last injection last Monday But Ive never experienced such a drastic improvement in such a short time

Right now Im honestly just stunned and losing my mind

I cant help but wonderwould my life have turned out differently if I had just eaten more slowly all along

"Symptoms flare up, what’s the cause?","The title is a bit misleading as I can already guess the cause but Im not sure whether or not Im right or wrong


for my own sake Ill have to use the German words for the medication
I got diagnosed with Crohns disease in march  and then went through treatment with cortison and azathioprin We noticed rather quickly that azathioprin alone was not cutting it so we switched to Infliximab a tnf blocker injected by the machine in the hospital This one worked fine in a sense of symptoms not worsening but slight stomach pains still being there I have a rather high pain tolerance so it was not relevant enough for me to focus on as I barely noticed it My arthritis however did not change in intensity with the treatment which was a bummer 

Now when I turned  I had to switch doctors who switched out infliximab to adalimumab about  months ago I already went through one pack so I took like  doses so far meaning  weeks have passed

 weeks ago I was really sick coughing every  seconds and barely breathing through my nose so I quit taking meds cause I knew I wouldnt be able to swallow them Not smart Im fully aware but I struggle with taking pills as of recently and I know another semitraumatic choking experience is not gonna help this I guess this went on for like  weeks 

Now my symptoms are flaring up I was sick for  months before getting diagnosed and while Im not like at the  month mark I did feel like standing was difficult with the pain today meaning  months in would be similar to the pain described 

The issue with that is is that while I would usually judge it based on the new tnf blocker I am scared it might be because I didnt take my other meds consistently for a while Idk how likely either is but I have an appointment at the doctors soon and Im not sure to which extent I should mention the symptoms worsening because it might not be related to the new medication and rather to my own stupidity Does anyone happen to have some more knowledge on the subject than me here Logically I would just tell the doctor about both for him to judge the situation However I dont know this doctor and so far I did not feel as comfortable around him and Im scared of his reaction I also plan on changing doctors in the near future because this place scares me

Looking for similar experiences-Crohn's or not?,"Hello fellow sufferers

Ive been struggling with stomach issues for a few years now Main symptom has been extreme nausea discomfort after eating stomach pains and switching between constipation no BM for  days and loose stools for several times during one day These symptoms come in phases with bad phases now being longer and more frequent that the good ones Due to nausea I have not been able to eat at times and have lost around  kg

After being dismissed by various doctors they said my symptoms were psychosomatic and caused by stress I finally found one private and abroad who was willing to do a colonoscopy The colonoscopy showed aphthous ulcers covered with fibrin in terminal ileum and punctiform erosions in cecum The biopsy of these samples showed flattened and atrophic villi increased numbers of neutrophilic granulocytcs and epithelioid cell granulomas without necrosis The doctors diagnosis was Crohns disease and he prescribed prednisone and azathioprine

My calprotectin goes up and down randomly the highest was  and lowest  Similar is with CRP highest being around  I also have low iron and vitamin D levels

Following colonoscopy I registered at the local public hospital thinking I can start the long term treatment monitored by a care team The doctor that was assigned to me was not sure of the diagnosis and followed it with MR of the small bowel that was clear and showed no signs of Crohns disease

The MR only deepened the doctors doubt and she is not willing to proceed with the Crohns diagnosis and has no advice on how to manage my symptoms other that of the counter pain killers and laxatives nothing for nausea She thinks it is best to wait to see how the situation develops and if it gets worse to do another colonoscopy in approximately  months

Officially diagnosed (sorry long story),"Well I guess I have to officially join this group now after lurking for a little while  My story is as follows starting in mid June I started having explosive diarrhea with burning after traveling to Mexico every day sometimes x per day  Went to urgent care they gave me an antibiotic  That didnt help much so In August I went to a GI specialist who did a stool sample that came back with a parasite called cyclospora  I took Bactrim to clear up the cyclospora but I continued to have burning and loose stools  

Went back to doc who suggested we do a colonoscopy to make sure everything else is okay  Due to scheduling it took until February th to finally get in for the colonoscopy in the mean time I would go between being completely fine a lot of the time to burning in the stomach with loose stools especially when stressed but nothing that Pepto bismuth couldnt take care of  

I had been doing really good recently so I even told the doc before the colonoscopy this feels like an overreaction it was probably just stress induced IBS  She said we will take a good look  When I woke up from colonoscopy she goes well its not IBS we removed  mm non cancerous polyps and you have quite a bit of inflammation throughout your entire colon anal fissures and ulcers in your Terminal Illium leading into your small intestine  This is my specialty and my focus area and this is very consistent with crohns  We took some biopsies and were going to start you on prednisone  After  days on prednisone I became an anxious wreck so we switched me to a mg budesonide taper which has been way better I dont really even feel like Im taking anything  

I went in for my follow up yesterday and she said the biopsies came back normal but thats not abnormal that being said there is no way this isnt crohns you have an SESCD score of  and with the inflammation and ulcers we need to treat this as such  So shes starting the insurance process of putting me on skyrizi as well  

Whats crazy to me is when I read about other peoples symptoms I feel like I dont have any  My biggest trigger is stress no specific foods except dairy but thats only occasionally sometimes dairy doesnt affect me at all  I can eat nuts salads raw fruits and veggies all the stuff you shouldnt with no problems  I asked about the lack of true crohns symptoms and she basically said that we caught it before they manifested same thing for the biopsies coming back normal  Long story short I guess the cyclospora parasite was a godsend  So I will be joining you fine people on this unfortunate journey

Fast forward to the beginning of February my mom couldnt keep food or even water down So we finally took her to the hospital She got another colonoscopy to see what was going on About a year ago she had a colonoscopy and they said theres some inflammation but not enough for them to diagnose it as anything During this more recent colonoscopy she has inflammation all the way up to her stomach They actually couldnt even do a full examination because she started wrenching and coughing She was in the hospital for about  weeks until they decided it was ok to send her home with some stronger prescriptions She also has to talk to her doctor to get a biologic but thats a whole other pain in the ass situation

My mom was home for a couple days until she ended up passing out in our bathroom She was taken back to the hospital and they found  blood clots in her lungs They did surgery to remove them put her on blood thinners and started physical therapy to help prevent anymore from forming She was in the hospital for another week and came home for a few hours yesterday until she ended up passing out again Shes back at the hospital all of her vitals are good but theyre calling in a heart specialist to possibly put her on more medication

TLDR My mom has been in and barely out of the hospital due Crohns disease passing out blood clots in her lungs due to the medication for Crohns and is now back in the hospital Shell be seeing a heart specialist to put her on more medication

Is this all normal when trying to treat Crohns Did you or someone close to you have to be put on several medications before seeing things get better or being put on a biologic My dad and I just really dont know what to do We just want her to be home and see her getting better I hope that hearing some of your stories will help with strength and support as we try to navigate through this",2025-03-07 12:03:56,424,hello try keep story short mom dealing bathroom issue past couple month called gastroenterologist get appointment june prescribed medication felt like medication making worse kept calling would prescribe thing fast forward beginning february mom keep food even water finally took hospital got another colonoscopy see going year ago colonoscopy said inflammation enough diagnose anything recent colonoscopy inflammation way stomach actually even full examination started wrenching coughing hospital week decided ok send home stronger prescription also talk doctor get biologic thats whole pain as situation mom home couple day ended passing bathroom taken back hospital found blood clot lung surgery remove put blood thinner started physical therapy help prevent anymore forming hospital another week came home hour yesterday ended passing back hospital vitals good calling heart specialist possibly put medication tldr mom barely hospital due crohn disease passing blood clot lung due medication crohn back hospital seeing heart specialist put medication normal trying treat crohn someone close put several medication seeing thing get better put biologic dad really know want home see getting better hope hearing story help strength support try navigate,Positivo,0.9864,Negativo

Diagnosis Trouble Update,"HI All I initially posted in this forum about my diagnosis troubles See below



  
I am still pending a diagnosis but wanted to share some of the test results that I have gotten in the mean time As well as some additional information from my past history with GI doctors

My newest results are as follows 

 Calprotectin Fecal 
     Normal Range

 CT Abdomen Pelvis Enterography W Contrast
    Mild terminal ileitis and right hemicolitis No evidence of penetrating disease 
    Submucosal fat deposition in the terminal ileum and entire colon and rectum can be seen with prior inflammation or be secondary to metabolic dysfunction

    Submucosal fat deposition in the terminal ileum as well as the entire colon and rectum Even given this there is mild wall thickening at the terminal ileum cecum ascending colon and transverse colon Prominent nodes in the right colic mesentery No obstruction No CT findings to suggest penetrating disease

How long did your fissure last? (& sorta rant),"So I saw my GP a month ago about a fissure According to her its only mild but it sure as hell doesnt feel like it The fissure has split my arsehole and created a little flap that is not as sore as it was but still not great I had one a few years ago while undiagnosed and being constantly assured I was fine by another doctor with no testing which is another story and I honestly dont remember how long it took to stop hurting My specialist is aware of all this and I have a routine sigmoidoscopy next week because Im currently unable to take biologics thank you HPV and am not in a good state

I was prescribed rectogesic hydrocortisone clotrimazole and lidocaine and am currently only on rectogesic Pain meds wise nothing Ive been in bed for  weeks Got up and cooked yesterday because Im so bored and today I paid for it both with physical pain and standard oooh you ate actual solid FOOD pain

I know if it doesnt get better in  weeks I have to speak to then again but seriously is this the best we can do Im so frustrated its unreal

I havent been well enough to leave the house for a year Ive been suffering with this since  but now Im just so goddamn irritated I had a life My gf is amazing my parents are so supportive and let me move back in with them a few years back because I cant live alone rn I used to be able to walk my dog for longer than  minutes now my mum does that instead I cried yesterday because I went outside and stood in the garden and I havent done that in over a month Im a writer and I cant even sit at my PC for longer than a few minutes most days Im anemic again  months after an infusion and Im just so done

UK so  month waiting list for mental health services and Im not on PIP I guess Im lucky that I was eligible for limited capability for work but that was based on my mental health instead of my physical conditions and I dont take antidepressants anymore so Im permanently worried theyll snatch that away too

I just want to be able to take my gf on a date to the park which I could do last year I want to finish the book Im over halfway through writing I want to walk my dog

Frustrated after my colonoscopy and endoscopy:(,"Rant incoming

I just had my colonoscopy and endoscopy done and the doctor told me they found nothing out of the ordinary I simply burst out in tears

Ive been struggling with symptoms like either extreme diarrhea or being constipated for several days and this for weeksmonthsyears on and off and this has only gotten worse the last  years Nowadays Im having extreme cramps every time I eat Ive lost kg in the last  months Often my food simply just doesnt digest or runs straight through me Sometimes its pasty and slimy like why is it doing all that lmao Im so tired all the time Ive tried not eating milk products Ive tried eating more fibres I eat a healthy diet Its hard to tell if its food related because Im often in pain no matter what I eat or dont eat 

Maybe its weird to say but I was so hopeful that theyd at least find something today Like there was no way that Im having all these symptoms even from when I was a child until now and there is nothing to see 

They did take biopsies from my stomach large intestines etc from which Ill know results in about a week or two Is it possible that they cant see anything but it might still be IBD 

I feel like I have to start from zero again all the while being in so much pain 

Does anyone have any tips for what I could do from here on out I dont know what comes next Any advice would be so so appreciated

Since I have ankylosing Spondylitis my doctor ordered a CT enterography with contrast It just came back completely clear and had many things listed on the Scan as normal 

She said I dont have IBD which is good but I dont know what else to do because there is   something wrong Ive had normal bowel movements my entire life eat clean etc

"GI issues for months, help!","Hello everyone

This is quite a long story but I wanted to share it and hear your thoughts Back in July  I was out with friends at McDonalds eating and having fun when suddenly I felt VERY dizzy and started having hot flashes nausea etc I felt really bad so I went home and ran to the bathroom to vomit but nothing would come out even though I tried Then I started having diarrhea TMI sorry and shaking a lot like my whole body was trembling

The next day I woke up feeling better ate normally but at night the same symptoms came back From that day on I was sicker than ever in my life I couldnt get out of bed I had nausea and diarrhea every second of the day I was extremely weak dizzy and nauseous

I went to the doctor who said it was food poisoning and gave me two antibiotics but they didnt help I was still feeling awful with the same symptoms so I was hospitalized because I was really really sick They ran a lot of stool testsno inflammation no bacteria nothing showed up and everything came back negative C diff Salmonella etc So they diagnosed me with gastroenteritis not sure if thats the right word in English and the doctors just told me to endure it and wait

I was extremely sick for over a month barely able to eat When I did I only ate white rice chicken breast boiled potatoes carrots and bananas That was it guys Those were the only things I ate for almost the rest of the summer yet I still had nausea weakness diarrhea and urgency to go to the bathroom However I didnt have any stomach pain or anything like that

I went to many doctors and no one could tell me anything until one finally decided to do a colonoscopy and an endoscopy Here are the results
		Mild nonspecific chronic duodenitis inflammation of the duodenum
		Mild chronic gastritis inflammation of the stomach but no Helicobacter pylori
		Mild chronic ileitis inflammation in the ileum with hyperplastic lymphoid follicles suggesting an immune reaction
		Mild chronic colitis and moderate chronic proctitis inflammation of the colon and rectum with cryptitis but no signs of microscopic colitis

In short I had and still have gastritis and inflammation in my intestines I was tested twice and both times the results were negative but the findings werent very specific

Ive tried probiotics antiinflammatory pills for my intestines leaky gut supplements and other treatments but I still have diarrhea my stools never went back to normal and my doctor doesnt know what to do with me Theyre unsure whether I have colitis Crohns IBS or something else

If anyone has experienced something similar I would love to hear your story because I feel like Im at a dead end This is really affecting my mental healthto the point where I cant even sleep at night and I feel depressed I dont understand why no treatment works I dont know what I have besides gastritis which Id love to talk about but this is already too long and I feel lost

What is “normal”?,"I have had chronic diarrhea for as long as I can remember Im in my mid thirties and was diagnosed with crohns late last year In the summer time when its hot and my symptoms are at their worst I have diarrhea half of the days of the month When its colder maybe  days of the month 

I started on Skyrizi infusions in December my third one is on Friday I have bad luck so unfortunately I contracted c diff a few weeks ago and had to work through that so I cant really give accurate input on my progress 

But what should I be expecting from remission Do most people not ever have diarrhea unless theyre sick Should I have NORMAL BMs EVERY DAY 

What is a flare I have diarrhea on and off constantly Sometimes its days at a time or maybe its just here and there Idk I feel like Im so used to this as my normal that I cant figure out what Im looking for on meds
